# Lesson 16 A polite request

## 中文

一旦你把汽车停错了地方，交通警很快就会发现。

如果他没给你罚单就放你走了，算你走运。

然而，情况并不都是这样，交通警有时也很客气。

有一次在瑞典度假，我发现我的车上有这样一个字条：

“先生，欢迎您光临我们的城市。

此处是"禁止停车“区。

如果您对我们街上的标牌稍加注意，您在此会过得很愉快的。

谨此提请注意。”

如果你收到这样的恳求，你是不会不遵照执行的！

## 英文

If you park your car in the wrong place **[pleɪs]**, a traffic **[ˈtræfɪk]** policeman will soon find it.

You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket.

However **[haʊˈevə(r)]**, this does not always happened. Traffic police are sometimes very polite **[pəˈlaɪt]**.

During a holiday in Sweden **[ˈswiːd(ə)n]**, I found this note on my car:

"Sir, we welcome **[ˈwelkəm]** you to our city. 

This is a "No Parking" area **[ˈeəriə]**. 

You will enjoy stay here if you pay attention to our street **[striːt]** signs **[saɪnz]**. 

This note is only a reminder".

If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey **[əˈbeɪ]** it!
