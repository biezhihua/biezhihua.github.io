# Lesson 11 One good turn deserves another

## 中文

我正在一家饭馆吃饭，托尼.斯蒂尔走了进来。

托尼曾在一家律师事务所工作，而现在正在一家银行上班。

他的薪水很高，但他却总是向朋友借钱，并且从来不还。

托尼看见了我，就走过来和我坐到一张桌子前。

他从未向我借过钱，但他吃饭时，我提出向他借20英镑。

令我惊奇的是，他立刻把钱给了我。

“我还未向你借过钱。”托尼说道，“所以现在你可以替我付饭钱了！”

## 英文

I was having dinner at a restaurant **[ˈrestrɒnt]** when Tony **[ˈtəʊni]** Steele **[stiːl]** came **[keɪm]** in.

Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank.

He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back.

Tony saw me and came and sat **[sæt]** at the same table.

He never borrowed money from **[frɒm]** me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend **[lend]** me twenty pounds.

To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately **[ɪˈmiːdiətli]**.

"I have never borrowed any money from you" Tony said, "so now you can pay for my dinner"
