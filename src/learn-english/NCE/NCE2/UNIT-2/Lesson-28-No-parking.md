# Lesson 28 No parking

## 中文

贾斯珀.怀特是少有的相信古代神话的人之一。

他刚在城里买下一所新房子，但自从搬进去后，就和汽车及车主们发生了磨擦。

当他夜里回到家时，总是发现有人把车停在他家大门外。

为此，他甚至一次也没能把自己的车开进车库。

贾斯珀曾把几块“禁止停车”的牌子挂在大门外边，但没有任何效果。

现在他把一个丑陋的石雕头像放在了大门上边，这是我见过的最丑陋的头像之一。

我问他那是什么？他告诉我那是蛇发女怪美杜莎。

贾斯珀希望她把汽车和车主们都变成石头。

但到目前为止还没有一个变成石头呢！

## 英文

Jasper **[ˈdʒæspə(r)]** White **[waɪt]** is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths **[mɪθs]**.

He has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since **[sɪns]** he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners.

When he returns home at night, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate.

Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once.

Jasper has put up "No Parking" signs **[saɪnz]** outside his gate, but these have not had any effect.

Now he has put an ugly **[ˈʌɡli]** stone head over the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces **[ˈfeɪsɪz]** I have ever seen.

I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon.

Jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone.

But none **[nʌn]** of them has been turned to stone yet.
