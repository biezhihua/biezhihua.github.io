# Lesson 35 Stop thief 

## 中文

捉贼

罗伊.特雷顿原是开出租汽车的。

然而就在前不久，他开上了公共汽车，也并不为此而感到后悔。

他发觉自己的新工作令人兴奋得多。

最近，当他正开车在凯特福德街上行驶时，看到有两个小偷从一家商店里冲出来，奔向等在那里的一辆汽车，其中一个提着一只装满钞票的提包。

罗伊行动迅速，开车直冲窃贼而去。

拿钱的那个小偷吓得把提包都扔了。

当那两个小偷企图乘车逃跑时，罗伊驾驶他的公共汽车撞在了那辆车的后尾上。

当那辆被撞坏的车开走后，罗伊停下车，给警察挂了电话。

小偷的车损坏严重，很容易辨认。

没过多久，警察就截住了那辆车，两个小偷都被抓住了。
