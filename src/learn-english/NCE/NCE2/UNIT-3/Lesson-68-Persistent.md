## 中文

纠缠不休

我穿过马路以便避开他，但他看到我并朝我跑过来。

若再装作没看见他已是没有用了，我只好向他招手。

我就怕遇到奈杰尔.戴克斯。

他从来都是无事可做，不管你多忙，他总是坚持要跟你去。

我得想办法不让他整个上午缠着我。

“你好，奈杰尔，想不到在这儿见到你。”我说。

“你好，伊丽莎白，”奈杰尔回答说，“我正不知道怎么消磨这一上午呢，正好见到好。你不忙，是吗？”

“不，不忙，我打算去......”我回答。

“我跟你一道去行吗？”没等我说完话他就问道。

“没关系，但我准备去牙医那里。”我说了个谎。

“那我也跟你去，候诊室里总有很多东西可供阅读！”他回答。

## 英文

I crossed **[krɒst]** the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me.

It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him.

I never enjoy meeting Nigel **[ˈnaɪdʒəl]** Dykes **[daɪks]**. 

He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you.

I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

"Hello, Nigel" I said "Fancy **[ˈfænsi]** meeting you here!"

"Hi, Elizabeth **[ɪˈlɪzəbəθ]**" Nigel answered. "I was just wondering **[ˈwʌndərɪŋ]** how to spend the morning - until I saw you, You're not busy doing anything, are you?"

"No, not at all" I answered, "I'm going to ..."

"Would you mind my coming with you?" he asked, before I had finished speaking.

"Not at all" I lied, "but I'm going to the dentist"

"Then I'll come with you" he answered "There's always plenty **[ˈplenti]** to read in the waiting room!"
