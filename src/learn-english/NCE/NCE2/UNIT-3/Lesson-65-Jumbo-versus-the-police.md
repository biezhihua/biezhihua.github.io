# Lesson 65 Jumbo versus the police 

## 中文

小象对警察

去年圣诞节，马戏团老板吉米.盖茨决定送些礼物给儿童医院。

他打扮成圣诞老人，在由6个漂亮姑娘组成的“仪仗队”的陪同下，骑上一头名叫江伯的小象，沿着城里的主要街道出发了。

他本该知道警察绝不会允许这类事情发生。

一个警察走过来告诉吉米，他应该走一条小路，因为江泊阻碍了交通。

虽然吉米同意马上就走，但江伯却拒绝移动。

15个警察不得不用很大的力气把它推离主要街道。

警察虽然吃了苦头，但他们还是感到很有趣。

“江伯一定有好几吨重，”一个警察事后这样说，“值得庆幸的是它没让我们抬它走。当然，我们应该逮捕它，但由于它一贯表现很好，这次我们饶了它。”
