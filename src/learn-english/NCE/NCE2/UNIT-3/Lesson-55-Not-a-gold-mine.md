# Lesson 55 Not a gold mine

## 中文

并非金矿

最近，找到失踪宝藏的梦想差一点儿变成现实。

一种叫“探宝器”的新机器已经发明出来，并被人们用来探测地下埋藏的金子。

在靠近海边的一个据说过去海盗常在里面藏金子的岩洞里，这种机器被派上了用场。

海盗们过去常把金子埋藏在那个洞里，可后来却没能取走。

一支用这种新机器装备起来的探宝队进入了这个岩洞，希望找到埋藏着的金子。

当这个队的队长正在检查洞口附近的土壤时，那台机器显示出它的下面埋有金子。

队员们异常激动，就地挖了一个两英尺深的坑，但最后找到的是一枚几乎一钱不值的小金币。

队员们接着又把整个洞彻底搜寻了一遍，但除了一只空铁皮箱外什么也没找到。

尽管如此，很多人仍然相信“探宝器”很快就会探出值钱的东西来。

## 英文

Dreams **[driːmz]** of finding lost **[lɒst]** treasure **[ˈtreʒə(r)]** almost came true recently.

A new machine called 'The Revealer **[rɪˈvi:lə]**' has been invented and it has been used to detect **[dɪˈtekt]** gold which has been buried **[ˈberid]** in the ground.

The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where - it is said - pirates **[ˈpaɪrəts]** used to hide gold.

The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.

Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.

The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance **[ˈentrəns]** to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.

Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.

The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly **[ˈθʌrəli]** but did not find anything except **[ɪkˈsept]** an empty tin trunk.

In spite of this, many people are confident **[ˈkɒnfɪdənt]** that 'The Revealer' may reveal **[rɪˈviːl]** something of value fairly soon.
