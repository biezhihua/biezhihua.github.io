# Lesson 52 A pretty carpet 

## 中文 

漂亮的地毯

我们刚刚搬进一所新房子，我辛辛苦苦地干了整整一个上午。

我试图把我的新房间收拾整齐，但这并不容易，因为我有1,000多本书。

更糟糕的是房间还非常小，所以我暂时把书放在了地板上。

这会儿，书把地板的每一点空隙都占据了，我实际上是踩着这些书进出房间的。

几分钟前，我妹妹帮我把一个旧书橱抬上了楼。

她走进我的房间，当她看到地板上的那些书时，大吃一惊。

“这是我见过的最漂亮的地毯，”她说。

她盯着“地毯”看了一会儿，又说：“你根本用不着书橱，空闲时你可以坐在这儿读地毯！”

## 英文

We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning.

I have been trying to get my new room in order. This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books.

To make matters worse, the room is rather **[ˈrɑːðə(r)]** small, so I have temporarily **[ˈtemprərəli]** put my books on the floor.

At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room.

A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs **[steəz]**.

She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor.

'This is the prettiest **[p'rɪtɪɪst]** carpet **[ˈkɑːpɪt]** I have ever seen.' she said.

She gazed **[ɡeɪzd]** at it for some time then added, "You don't need bookcases at all, You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!"
