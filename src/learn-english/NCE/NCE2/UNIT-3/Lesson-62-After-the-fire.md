## 中文

大火之后

消防队员们同那场森林大火搏斗了将近3个星期才最后把火势控制住。

就在不久之前，参天大树还覆盖着方圆数英里的土地。

而现在，发热的地面上仍然升腾着烟雾，弥漫在荒凉的山丘上。

冬季即将来临，这些山丘对周围的村庄具有毁灭性的威胁，因为大雨不仅会冲走土壤，而且还会引起严重的水灾。

在大火最后被扑灭后，森林管理当局订购了好几吨一种生长迅速的特殊类型的草籽。

飞机把这种草籽大量地撒播在地上。

飞机撒播近一个月后，开始下起雨来。

然而到那时，很多地方的草已经生了根。

一片片的绿草开始出现在这片烧焦的土地上，代替了多少世纪以来一直生长在那里的参天大树。

Firemen had been fighting **[ˈfaɪtɪŋ]** the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control.

A short time before, great trees had covered **[ˈkʌvəd]** the countryside for miles around.

Now, smoke still rose **[rəʊz]** up from the warm ground over the desolate **[ˈdesələt]** hills.

Winter was coming on and the hills threatened **[ˈθret(ə)nd]** the surrounding villages with destruction **[dɪˈstrʌkʃ(ə)n]**, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods **[flʌdz]** as well.

When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities **[ɔːˈθɒrətiz]** ordered several tons **[tʌnz]** of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly.

The seed was sprayed **[spred]** over the ground in huge **[hjuːdʒ]** quantities **[kˈwɒntɪtɪz]** by airplanes.

The planes had been planting **[ˈplɑːntɪŋ]** seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.

By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root.

In place of great trees which had been growing there for centuries **[ˈsentʃəriz]**, patches **[ˈpætʃɪz]** of green had begun to appear in the blackened **[ˈblækənd]**.
