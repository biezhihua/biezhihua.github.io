# Lesson 69 But not murder 

## 中文

并非谋杀

我第3次接受驾驶执照考试。

按照要求在车辆拥挤的路上驾驶，我圆满地完成了。

在接到把车开出城的指令后，我开始有了信心。

确信我已通过考试，所以我几乎开始喜欢起这次考试。

主考人对我的驾驶想必是满意的。

因为他微笑着说：“埃姆斯先生，只剩1项了。让我们假设一个小孩子突然在你前面穿过马路。我一敲车窗，你必须把车停在5英尺之内。”

我继续往前开着。过了一会儿，主考人砰砰地敲了起来。

虽然声音听得很清楚，但我过了好一会儿才作出反应。

我突然用力踩紧刹车踏板，结果我俩的身体都向前冲去。

主考人伤心地看着我。

“埃姆斯先生，”他以悲伤的声调说，“你刚刚把那个小孩压死了！”

Eames

## 英文

I was being tested for a driving **[ˈdraɪvɪŋ]** license **[ˈlaɪsns]** for the third **[θɜːd]** time.

I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.

After having been instructed **[ɪnˈstrʌktɪd]** to drive out of town, I began to acquire **[əˈkwaɪə(r)]** confidence **[ˈkɒnfɪdəns]**.

Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.

The examiner **[ɪɡˈzæmɪnə(r)]** must have been pleased **[pliːzd]** with my performance **[pəˈfɔːməns]**.

For he smiled and said: 

"Just one more thing, Mr.Eames **[iːmz]**. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you. As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet."

I continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped **[tæpt]** loudly.

Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react. 

I suddenly pressed the brake **[breɪk]** pedal **[ˈped(ə)l]** hard and we were both thrown forward **[ˈfɔːwəd]**.

The examiner looked at me sadly. 'Mr.Eames,' he said, in a mournful **[ˈmɔːnfl]** voice, 'you have just killed that child **[tʃaɪld]** !'
