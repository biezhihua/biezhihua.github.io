火山

波兰科学家哈罗恩.塔捷耶夫花了毕生的精力来研究世界各地的活火山和探洞。

1948年他去了刚果的基伍湖，对一座后来被他命名为基图罗的新火山进行观察。

当火山正在猛烈地喷发时，塔捷耶夫有办法把帐篷搭在离它非常近的地方。

尽管他设法拍了一些十分精彩的照片，但他却不能在火山附近停留太长的时间。

他发现有一股岩浆正向他流过来，眼看就要将他团团围住，但塔捷耶夫还是设法及时逃离了。

他等到火山平静下来，两天以后又返回去。

这次他设法爬进了基图罗火山口，以便能拍摄照片和测试温度。

塔捷耶夫经常冒这样的生命危险。

他能告诉我们的有关活火山的情况比任何在世的人都要多。

Haroun Tazieff, the Polish **[ˈpəʊlɪʃ]** scientist **[ˈsaɪəntɪst]**, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world.

In 1948, he went to Lake **[leɪk]** Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro.

Tazieff was able to set up his camp **[kæmp]** very close to the volcano while it was erupting **[ɪˈrʌpt]** violently.

Though he managed to take a number of brilliant **[ˈbrɪliənt]** photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long.

He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened **[ˈθret(ə)nd]** to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape **[ɪˈskeɪp]** just in time.

He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later.

This time, he managed to climb **[klaɪm]** into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure **[ˈmeʒə(r)]** temperatures **[ˈtemprətʃər]**.

Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.
