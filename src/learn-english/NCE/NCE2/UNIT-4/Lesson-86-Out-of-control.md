# Lesson 86 Out of control 

## 中文

失控

当那人试图让快艇转弯时，方向盘脱手了。

他绝望地向他的伙伴挥手，他的伙伴在过去的15分钟里一直在滑水。

他们两个还没来得及意识到究竟发生了什么事情，就被猛地抛入了海里。

快艇撞上了一个浮标，但它仍在水面上快速行驶着。

两个人刚开始向岸边游去，就突然惊愕地发现快艇正在转着圈行驶，它现在正以惊人的速度直冲他们驶来。

不到1分钟的工夫，它从离他们只有几英尺远的地方呼啸着驶了过去。

快艇过去之后，他们以最快的速度向前游去，因为他们知道快艇马上就要转回来。

他们刚刚来得及游出危险区，快艇就又转完了一圈。

然而这一次它的速度慢多了。

汽油几乎已经用光。

没过多久，噪音便彻底消失，快艇开始在水面上慢悠悠地漂流。
