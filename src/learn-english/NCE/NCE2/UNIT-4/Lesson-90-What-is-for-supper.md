# Lesson 90 What's for supper？ 

## 中文

晚餐吃什么

油煎鱼加炸土豆片一直是英国人喜爱的一道菜，但是随着海洋里的滥捕滥捞，鱼已经变得越来越昂贵。

因此，听说北海石油钻井平台上的潜水员受到巨型鱼类的恐吓，确实很让人吃惊。

钻井平台需要经常修理，潜水员常常要在水面100英尺以下摸黑工作，他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的大鱼吓得惊惶失措。

现在他们有了特制的笼子，用来保护他们免受大鱼的侵袭。

这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或逆戟鲸，而是深受人们喜爱的食用鱼品种，如鳕鱼和鳐鱼，只不过它们长得出奇地大，有时长达12英尺。

这些鱼能长得这么大是由3个因素造成的：
- 海底热的输油管道附近的温暖的海水；
- 钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物；
- 钻井平台周围根本没有捕鱼船只。

结果是，这些鱼就在可爱的温暖的水流中吃呀吃，长呀长。

究竟谁吃谁呢？

## 英文

What's for supper **[ˈsʌpə(r)]**

Fish and chips has always been a favourite **[ˈfeɪvərɪt]** dish in Britain **[ˈbrɪt(ə)n]**, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive **[ɪkˈspensɪv]**.

So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant **[ˈdʒaɪənt]** fish are terrifying **[ˈterɪfaɪɪŋ]** the divers **[ˈdaɪvəz]** on North Sea oil **[ɔɪl]** rigs **[rɪɡz]**.

Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently **[ˈfriːkwəntli]** and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened **[ˈfraɪt(ə)nd]** out of their wits **[wɪts]** by giant fish bumping **[ˈbʌmpɪŋ]** into them as they work.

Now they have had special cages **[ˈkeɪdʒɪz]** made to protect them from these monsters **[ˈmɒnstəz]**.

The fish are not sharks or killer whales **[weɪlz]**, but favourite eating varieties **[vəˈraɪətiz]** like cod **[kɒd]** and skate **[skeɪt]** which grow to unnatural **[ʌnˈnætʃrəl]** size **[saɪz]**, sometimes as twelve feet in length.

Three factors **[ˈfæktəz]** have caused **[kɔːzd]** these fish to grow so large: 

- the warm water round the hot oil pipes **[paɪps]** under the sea; 

- the plentiful **[ˈplentɪf(ə)l]** supply **[səˈplaɪ]** of food thrown overboard by the crew on the rigs;

- the total absence **[ˈæbsəns]** of fishing boats around the oil rigs.

As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. 

Who eats who?
