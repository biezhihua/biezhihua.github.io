# Lesson 83 After the elections 

## 中文

大选之后

前首相温特沃兹.莱恩先生在最近的大选中被击败。

他现在退出了政界，到国外去了。

我的朋友帕特里克一直是莱恩先生的激进党的强烈反对者。

大选结束后，帕特里克来到了前首相的住处。

当他询问莱恩先生是否住在那里时，值班的警察告诉他这位前首相落选后出国去了。

第二天，帕特里克再次来到首相的住处。

昨天的那位警察正从门口慢慢走过，帕特里克上前问了和昨天同样的问题。

虽然那位警察这次有点疑心，但还是对他作了同样的回答。

第三天，帕特里克又去了，提出了同前两天完全一样的问题。

这一次警察火了。

“我昨天和前天都告诉过您了，”他大叫着，“莱恩先生在大选中被击败了，他已经退出了政界去国外了！”

“这我都知道，”帕特里克说，“可我就是喜欢听你说出这些！”

The former **[ˈfɔːmə(r)]** Prime **[praɪm]** Minister **[ˈmɪnɪstə(r)]**, Mr.Wentworth Lane **[leɪn]**, was defeated **[dɪˈfiːtɪd]** in the recent elections **[ɪˈlekʃnz]**.

He is now retiring **[rɪˈtaɪərɪŋ]** from political **[pəˈlɪtɪk(ə)l]** life and has gone abroad **[əˈbrɔːd]**.

My friend, Patrick **[ˈpætrɪk]**, has always been a fanatical **[fəˈnætɪkl]** opponent **[əˈpəʊnənt]** of Mr.Lane's Radial **[ˈreɪdiəl]** Progressive Party.

After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house.

When he asked if Mr.Lane lived **[lɪvd]** there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.

On the following day, Patrick went to the house again.

The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance **[ˈentrəns]**, when Patrick asked the same question.

Though a little suspicious **[səˈspɪʃəs]** this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.

The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly **[ɪɡˈzæktli]** the same question.

This time, the policeman lost his temper **[ˈtempə(r)]**.

'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday' he shouted, 'Mr.Lane was defeated in the elections. He has retried from political life and gone to live abroad!'

'I know' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'
