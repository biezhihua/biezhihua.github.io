# Lesson 92 Asking for trouble 

## 中文

自找麻烦

我回到家时，肯定已是凌晨两点左右了。

我按响了门铃，试图唤醒我的妻子，但她睡得很熟。

于是，我从花园的小棚里搬来了一个梯子，把它靠在墙边，开始向卧室的窗口爬去。

快要爬到窗口时，下面一个人用讽刺的口吻说：“我看不必在夜里这个时候擦窗子吧。”

我向下面看去。当我看清是一个警察时，差一点儿从梯子上掉下去。

我回答了他的话，但马上又后悔不该那样说，我是这样说的：“我喜欢在夜里擦窗子。”

“我也是的，”警察用同样的声调回答，“请原谅我打断了您。当一个人在忙着干活时，我是不愿意去打断他的，但请您跟我到警察局去一趟好吗？”

“可我更愿意呆在这儿，”我说，“您瞧，我忘带钥匙了。”

“什么？”他大声问。

“钥匙！”我喊道。

幸运得很，这喊声惊醒了我的妻子。就在警察开始向我爬上来时，她打开了窗子。
