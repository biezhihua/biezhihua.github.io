# Lesson 85 Never too old to learn 

## 中文

活到老学到老

我刚刚收到母校的一封信，通知我说以前的校长斯图亚特.佩奇先生下星期就退休了。

为了纪念这个日子，学校的学生 -- 无论老同学还是新同学 -- 将送他一件礼物。

所有凑钱买此礼品的人都将自己的名字签在一本大签名簿上，签名簿将被送到校长的家里。

我们不会忘记佩奇先生对我们既有耐心又充满理解，也不会忘记在我们不愿去上学时他给予我们的亲切鼓励。

很多老同学都准备参加下星期四为他举行的告别宴会。

佩奇先生退休的前一天正好是他执教满40年的日子，这真是奇妙的巧合。

他退休后，将致力于园艺。

对于他来说，这将是一种全新的爱好。

但这没有关系，因为正如他常说的那样，人要活到老学到老。

## 英文

I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster **[ˌhedˈmɑːstə(r)]**, Mr.Stuart **[ˈstjuːət]** Page, will be retiring next week.

Pupils **[ˈpjuːp(ə)lz]** of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion **[əˈkeɪʒ(ə)n]**.

All those who have contributed **[kənˈtrɪbjuːtɪd]** towards the gift will sign their names in a large album **[ˈælbəm]** which will be sent to the headmaster's home.

We shall all remember Mr.Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly **[ˈkaɪndli]** encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly **[ʌnˈwɪlɪŋli]** to school.

A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour **[ˈɒnə(r)]** next Thursday **[ˈθɜːzdeɪ]**.
 
It is a curious coincidence **[kəʊˈɪnsɪdəns]** that the day before his retirement ,Mr.Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years.

After he has retired, he will devote himself to gardening.

For him, this will be an entirely **[ɪnˈtaɪəli]** new hobby **[ˈhɒbi]**.

But this does not matter, for , as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.
