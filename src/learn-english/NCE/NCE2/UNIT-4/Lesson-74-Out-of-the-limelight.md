# Lesson 74 Out of the limelight 

## 中文

舞台之外

一辆古旧的汽车停在一条干涸的河床边，一群著名男女演员下了车。

他们戴着墨镜，穿着旧衣裳，特别小心以防别人认出他们。

但他们很快就发觉，化装的效果有时过分完美了。

“在这个地方野餐简直太妙了，”格格利亚.格利姆说。

“是再好不过的了，格格利亚。”布林克斯利.米尔斯表示同意，“没有记者，没有影迷！我们为什么不经常来这里呢？”

此时，另外两位演员，罗克沃尔.斯林格和默林.格里夫斯，已经把两个大食品篮子提到了一片树荫下。

当他们都已安排舒适时，一个陌生人出现了。

他看上去非常气愤。“你们都从这里走开，全都走开！”他大叫着，“我是这里的司法长官。你们看到那个布告牌了吗？上面写着"禁止野营"－除非你们不识字！”

“好了，好了，司法官，”罗克沃尔说，

“别使我们难堪。我是罗克沃尔.斯林格，这位是默林.格里夫斯。”

“噢，是吗？”那位司法长官冷笑一声说道，“好，我就是布林克斯利.米尔斯。我还有一个名字叫格格利亚.格利姆。现在你们赶快滚吧！”

## 英文

An ancient bus stopped by a dry **[draɪ]** river bed and a party of famous actors **[ˈæktəz]** and actresses **[ˈæktrɪsɪz]** got off.

Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes, they had taken special precautions so that no one should recognize **[ˈrekəɡnaɪz]** them.

But as they soon discovered, disguises **[dɪsˈɡaɪzɪz]** can sometimes be too perfect.

"This is wonderful place for a picnic," said Gloria **[ˈɡlɔːriə]** Gleam **[ɡliːm]**.

"It couldn't be better, Gloria," Brinksley Meers agreed **[əˈɡriːd]**. "No newspaper men, no film fans! Why don't we come more often?"

Meanwhile, two other actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin **[ˈmɜːlɪn]** Greeves, had carried two large food baskets to a shady **[ˈʃeɪdi]** spot under some trees **[triːz]**.

When they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared.

He looked very angry. "Now you get out of here, all of you!" he shouted. "I'm sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says **[sez]** 'No Camping **[ˈkæmpɪŋ]**' -- in case you can't read!"

"Look, sheriff" said Rockwall, "don't be too hard on us. I'm Rockwall Slinger **[ˈslɪŋə(r)]** and this is Merlin Greeves."

"Oh, is it?" said the sheriff with a sneer. "Well, I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam. Now you get out of here fast!"
