# Lesson 76 April Fools' Day 

## 中文

愚人节

“作为我们专题新闻节目的结尾，” 电视广播员说。

“
我们现在到克拉布利亚的通心粉田里。

通心粉在这个地区已经种植了600多年了。

两个主要种植者，朱塞皮.莫尔道瓦和里卡多.布拉班特告诉我，他们一直期待着今年获得一个大丰收，收割工作比往年开始要早些。

这里您可以看到两个工人，他们协力割下了3车金黄色的通心粉秸。

全村的人都日夜奋战，要赶在9月的雨季之前把今年的庄稼收获上来，打完场。

在屏幕的右侧，您可以看到布拉班特太太本人，她已经帮了她的丈夫30年了。

布拉班特太太现在正和负责通心粉加工的当地加工厂的经理交谈。

这最后一个镜头向您展示了收获之后将发生的事情：著名的克拉布利亚人吃通心粉大赛！

目前的冠军弗拉特里先生，自1991年以来，年年获胜。

今天 -- 4月1日，星期四--的专题新闻节目到此结束。

现在我们回到电视演播室。
