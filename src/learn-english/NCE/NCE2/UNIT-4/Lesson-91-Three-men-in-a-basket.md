# Lesson 91 Three men in a basket 

## 中文

三人同篮

一个飞行员发现了一只气球，它像是正飞往附近的一个皇家空军基地。

他马上把情况报告了该基地，但那里的人没有一个能解释这到底是怎么回事。

控制塔上的官员得知这一消息后，非常气愤，因为气球有可能给飞机造成极大的危险。

他说可能有人正对基地进行侦察，因此命令那个飞行员跟踪那个奇怪的飞行物。

飞行员设法绕着气球飞了一阵。

他看清了气球下面有3个人呆在一只筐里，其中一个举着望远镜。

当气球飞临基地上空时，飞行员看见有一个人在拍照。

不久，气球开始降落，在一个停机坪附近着了陆。

警察被召来了，但他们却不能逮捕任何人，因为筐里是两名国会议员和一名基地的指挥官！

正如指挥官后来解释的那样，基地的这半边不知道那半边正在干什么！

## 英文

Three men in a basket **[ˈbɑːskɪt]**. 

A pilot **[ˈpaɪlət]** noticed a balloon **[bəˈluːn]** which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby.

He informed the station at once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery **[ˈmɪst(ə)ri]**.

The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard **[hɜːd]** the news, because balloon can be a great danger to aircraft.

He said that someone might be spying **[ˈspaɪɪŋ]** on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object.

The pilot managed **[ˈmænɪdʒd]** to circle the balloon for some time.

He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars **[bɪˈnɒkjələz]**.

When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs.

Soon afterwards, the balloon began **[bɪˈɡæn]** to descend **[dɪˈsend]** and it landed near an airfield.

The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone, for the basket contained **[kənˈteɪnd]** two Members of Parliament **[ˈpɑːləmənt]** and the Commanding Officer of the Station!

As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!
