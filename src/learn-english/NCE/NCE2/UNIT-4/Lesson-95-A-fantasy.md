纯属虚构

当艾斯卡罗比亚国的大使回到家吃午饭时，把他的夫人吓了一跳。

他面色苍白，衣服也搞得不成样子。

“发生了什么事？”她问，“你的衣服怎么搞得一塌糊涂？”

“灭火器弄的，亲爱的，”大使冷冷地回答，“今天上午大学生们放火点着了大使馆。”

“天啊！”他的夫人惊叫，“那你当时在什么地方？”

“我和往常一样，在办公室里，”大使回答说。

“地下室突然着火，我当然马上下去了。但那个傻瓜霍斯特把灭火器对准了我。他认为是我着火了。我一定要把那个家伙打发走。”

大使夫人继续提出问题，她突然又发现丈夫的帽子上有个洞。

“那么你对那又作何解释呢？”她问。

“那个嘛，”大使说，“有人向我办公室窗户开了一枪。真够准的，是不是？幸亏我当时没戴帽子。如果真戴着它，我现在就不能回家来吃午饭了。”

## 英文

A fantasy **[ˈfæntəsi]**.

When the Ambassador **[æmˈbæsədə(r)]** of Escalopia returned home for lunch **[lʌntʃ]**, his wife got a shock.

He looked pale **[peɪl]** and his clothes were in a frightful **[ˈfraɪtf(ə)l]** state.

'What has happened?' she asked. 'How did your clothes get into such mess?'

'A fire extinguisher **[ɪkˈstɪŋɡwɪʃə(r)]**, my dear' answered the Ambassador drily **[ˈdraɪli]**. 'University students set the Embassy **[ˈembəsi]** on fire this morning'

'Good heavens **[ˈhevənz]**!' exclaimed his wife. 'And where were you at the time?'

'I was in my office as usual,' answered the Ambassador.

'The fire broke out in the basement **[ˈbeɪsmənt]**. I went down immediately, of course, and that fool **[fuːl]**, Horst **[hɔːst]**, aimed **[eɪmd]** a fire extinguisher at me. He thought I was on fire. I must definitely **[ˈdefɪnətli]** get that fellow **[ˈfeləʊ]** posted **[ˈpəʊstɪd]**.'

The ambassador's wife went on asking questions, when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.

'And how can you explain that?' she asked.

'Someone fired a shot through my office window. Accurate **[ˈækjərət]**, don't you think? Fortunately, I wasn't wearing it at the time. If I had been, I would not have been able to get home for lunch.'
