# Lesson 78 The last one? 

## 中文

最后一支吗？

读完一篇题为《吸烟与健康》的文章之后，我点上了一枝香烟，来镇定一下自己紧张的神经。

我聚精会神而又愉快地吸着这枝烟。因为我确信这是我最后一枝烟了。

整整一个星期我根本没有吸烟。在此期间，我妻子吃尽了苦头。

我具备了戒烟者通常表现出来的所有症状：脾气暴躁和食欲旺盛。

我的朋友们不断地向我递香烟和雪茄。

每当我从口袋里掏出一包糖果时，他们都毫不掩饰地表现出他们对此感到非常好笑。

这样过了7天以后，我去参加一次聚会。

我周围的每个人都在吸烟，我感到非常不自在。

当我的老朋友布赖恩极力劝我接受一枝香烟时，我再也忍不住了。

我内疚地接过一枝点上，心满意足地抽起来。

一切又都恢复了正常，为此我妻子十分高兴。

不管怎么说，正如布赖恩指出的那样，戒烟是世界上最容易的事情。

他自己就已戒了很多次了！

## 英文

After reading an article entitled **[ɪnˈtaɪtld]** 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health', I lit a cigarette **[ˌsɪɡəˈret]** to calm **[kɑːm]** my nerves.

I smoked **[sməʊkt]** with concentration **[ˌkɒns(ə)nˈtreɪʃ(ə)n]** and pleasure **[ˈpleʒə(r)]** as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette.

For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered **[ˈsʌfəd]** terribly.

I had all the usual symptoms **[ˈsɪmptəmz]** of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper **[ˈtempə(r)]** and an enormous **[ɪˈnɔːməs]** appetite **[ˈæpɪtaɪt]**.

My friends **[frendz]** kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars.

They made no effort **[ˈefət]** to hide their amusement **[əˈmjuːzmənt]** whenever I produced **[prəˈdjuːst]** a packet **[ˈpækɪt]** of sweets from my pocket **[ˈpɒkɪt]**.

After seven days of this I went to a party. 

Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable.

When my old friend Brian **[ˈbraɪən]** urged **[ɜːrdʒd]** me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear.

I took **[tʊk]** one guiltily **[ˈɡɪltɪli]**, lit it and smoked with satisfaction.

My wife was delighted **[dɪˈlaɪtɪd]** that things had returned to normal once more.

Anyway, as Brian pointed **[ˈpɔɪntɪd]** out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. 

He himself has done it lots of times!
