# Lesson 73 The record-holder 

## 中文

纪录保持者

逃学的孩子们都缺乏想像力。

他们通常能够做到的，至多也就是安静地钓上一天鱼，或在电影院里坐上8个小时，一遍遍地看同一部电影。

而有那么一个小男孩，他在逃学期间旅行了1,600英里，从而使上述所有逃学的孩子们都相形见绌了。

他搭便车到了多佛，天快黑时钻进了一条船，想找个地方睡觉。

第二天早上他醒来时，发现船在这段时间已经到了加莱。

当男孩从船里爬出来时，谁也没有发现他。

从那里他又搭上卡车到了巴黎。

司机给了他几块饼干和一杯咖啡，就把他丢在了城外。

男孩截住的下一辆车，没有像他希望的那样把他带到巴黎市中心，而是把他带到了法国和西班牙边界上的佩皮尼昂。

他在那儿被一个警察抓住了，之后被当局送回了英国。

他无疑为成千上万梦想逃避上学的孩子们创造了一项纪录。

## 英文

Children who play truant from school are unimaginative **[ˌʌnɪˈmædʒɪnətɪv]**.

A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get.

They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1600 miles.

He hitchhiked **[ˈhɪtʃhaɪkt]** to Dover **[ˈdəʊvə(r)]** and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.

When he woke up next morning, he discovered **[dɪˈskʌvəd]** that the boat had, in the meantime, traveled to Calais **[ˈkæleɪ]**.

No one noticed **[ˈnəʊtɪst]** the boy as he crept off.

From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry **[ˈlɒri]**.

The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.

The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre **[ˈsentə(r)]** of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border.

There he was picked **[pɪkt]** up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.

He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading **[ɪˈveɪdɪŋ]** school.
