# [6.006 Introduction To Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)

## Lecture 1: Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding

This course covers:
- Efficient procedures for solving problems on large inputs (Ex: U.S. Highway Map,
Human Genome)
- Scalability
- Classic data structures and elementary algorithms (CLRS text)
- Real implementations in Python
- Fun problem sets!

The course is divided into 8 modules — each of which has a motivating problem and problem
set(s) (except for the last module). Tentative module topics and motivating problems are
as described below:
- Algorithmic Thinking: Peak Finding
- Sorting & Trees: Event Simulation
- Hashing: Genome Comparison
- Numerics: RSA Encryption
- Graphs: Rubik’s Cube
- Shortest Paths: Caltech → MIT
- Dynamic Programming: Image Compression
- Advanced Topics
