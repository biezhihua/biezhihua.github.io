VICTOR COSTAN: Hi, everyone.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,480
I am Victor.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,730
My full name is Victor Costan.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,610
I'm a third year Ph.D. student.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,150
I'm in CSAIL, and
I work in systems.

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,610
I do mostly security
and distributed systems.

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,675
And I'll be your algorithm
TA for this term.

17
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:40,290
Yay.

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,040
How many people went
to lecture yesterday?

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,340


20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,840
All right.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,850
Are there any parts
of the lecture that

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,610
were particularly unclear
that you guys want to go over?

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,410
So that I schedule what I
talk about in such a way

24
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,580
that I'll cover that
more than the parts

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,900
that are boring and obvious.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,874
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
complexity in equations,

27
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,210
because I took 042
like 3 years ago.

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,960
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,710


30
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,410
What else?

31
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,980
Thank you.

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,950


33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,938
AUDIENCE: Maybe some
basic outlines for, like,

34
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:29,872
writing proofs relevant
to like the [? psets ?]..

35
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:30,914
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

36
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:32,902
AUDIENCE: Sort of
methodology or something.

37
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:40,601


38
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,351
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

39
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,327


40
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:45,910
Anything else?

41
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:51,622


42
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,050
OK.

43
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,460
We're going to get started then.

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,990
So the hardest, and I think most
important of the whole course,

45
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,290
is learning how to deal
with asymptotic complexity.

46
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,370
So asymptotic complexity
is this very nice tool

47
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:16,510
where you have a function
that looks like this plus--

48
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,142
what'll I have here?

49
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:22,516
10 plus sin x.

50
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:32,240


51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,773
So you have this guy, which
is quite long and horrible

52
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,190
and would make
your life miserable

53
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,750
if you'd have to
reason about it.

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,760
And you can say that this
is theta of n squared.

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,360
x, sorry.

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,010


57
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,320
So everything that's
here goes away.

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,270
And this constant
factor here goes away,

59
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,640
and it's nice and
small function.

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
Why is that the
case, first of all?

61
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,420
If I plot this function--

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,480
and since I don't have
my projector you'll

63
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,430
have to take my word for it--

64
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,670
I will get something
that looks like this.

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,950


66
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,500
If I plug this
function, I will get

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,560
something that looks like this.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,800
This is a scale from 0 to 200.

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:38,260
However, if I make my
scale 0 to 20,000--

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,250
Let's say 200,000 to make sure
that is going to be correct.

71
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,910
x squared looks like this.

72
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,267
And this function
looks like this.

73
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,100
And as you make the
scale bigger and bigger,

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,290
you can't even see
this noise anymore.

75
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,000
The reason is that all
the noise is in this term.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,020
In the x to the power
of one fifth term.

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,720
And as n-- pretend this
is n, x, n same thing--

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,590
so as the input to the function
gets bigger and bigger,

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,589
this grows at a much
faster rate than this.

80
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,220
So if I don't care about
this, how the function grows,

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,870
I can ignore anything aside
from the dominant term.

82
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,828


83
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:30,370
Do people remember
this from lecture?

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,255
Does this make sense?

85
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:34,140


86
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,640
OK.

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,807
If it doesn't, that's great.

88
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:39,230
It means that I'm not
wasting time covering it.

89
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,638
So we learned about
three symbols,

90
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,180
or we will learn
about three symbols,

91
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,620
when talking about
asymptotic complexity.

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,790
The three symbols are
theta, O, and omega.

93
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,630
Let's say this
complicated function is g.

94
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,840
And this nice simple
function is f.

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,330


96
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:15,180
If I say that g of x is theta of
f of x, that means two things.

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,140
It means I have a lower
bound, like I showed here,

98
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,950
and the lower bound looks
something like x squared.

99
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,980
And it means that I
also have a higher--

100
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,390
an upper bound for it that
also looks like x squared.

101
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,390
So the upper bound would
be something like this.

102
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,110


103
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,660
And if I say this, then
I'm making a promise

104
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,790
that the function
stays between the lower

105
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,530
bound and the upper
bound, and the bounds

106
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,250
look sort of the same.

107
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,270
I can't really have x squared
here, and x squared here.

108
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,380
Right?

109
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,140
That would be impossible.

110
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,050
So that's why I said
they look the same.

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,090
They're not the same.

112
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,550
And they're not the same,
because they're allowed

113
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,040
to differ by a constant factor.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,730
So if this is f, and say
this is f prime, f of x

115
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,740
might be x squared.

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,710
And we know for sure that this
is going to be lower than this.

117
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:20,800
And f prime of x might
be 1.2 times x squared.

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,780
And because I have a 1.1 here--
and I know that these get

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,890
smaller and smaller in relation
to this as the function--

120
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,640
as the inputs to the
function get bigger--

121
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,620
I know that this is going
to be the dominating factor.

122
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,940
And because this is
bigger than this,

123
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,950
this function is
going to eventually

124
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,060
be larger than this function.

125
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,330
So I have a bound from above,
and I have a bound from below.

126
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,370
And the bounds look
almost the same.

127
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,740
They're only different
by a constant factor.

128
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,670
This is theta.

129
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,760
To make things spicier--

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,370
by the way, theta is really hard
to pronounce as opposed to O,

131
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,950
so we usually say and
write O instead of theta.

132
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,730
We'll talk about what O
really means in a bit.

133
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,740
But if you see O in a lot of
places, including our notes,

134
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,780
know that most of the time
we actually mean theta.

135
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,286
And sorry for that.

136
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,827
AUDIENCE: When do we
you actually mean O?

137
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,910
VICTOR COSTAN: You can ask
us, and we'll tell you.

138
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,050
[LAUGHTER]

139
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,250
Fortunately, it doesn't
a matter too much.

140
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,695
So we're trying to get an
idea of how the functions look

141
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:23,820
like in the bigger picture.

142
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,690
So most of the time
it doesn't matter.

143
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll give you an example
though of where it matters,

144
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,900
and how it could matter.

145
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,215
So suppose I have another
function that looks like this.

146
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,880


147
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,850
So this is kind of ugly, too.

148
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:56,000
This function is g of x,
say x times 1 plus sin of x.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,140


150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,730
So I can't say anything about
the lower bound of this.

151
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,750
This is going to hit 0 at an
infinite number of values.

152
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,250
Right?

153
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,950
So I can't say that--

154
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,670
I can't have a nice
lower bound for it.

155
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,680
The lower bound for it is 0.

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,780
But I'm pretty sure
that it's never

157
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,380
going to be bigger than 2x.

158
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,880
Right?

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,870
And that's still
worth something.

160
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,552
So there's this
other function here

161
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:23,760
that's supposed to be a line.

162
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,370
Pretend it's a line.

163
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,780
f of x equals 2x.

164
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,409
And I know for sure
that this is never

165
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,419
going to exceed these, this.

166
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,808
And in that case, where I
only have one upper bound,

167
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,798
and I don't have a good lower
bound, I say that g of x

168
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,670
is order of f of x.

169
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,220
And this is where--

170
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,230
This is what O really means.

171
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,230
It means that I only have
an upper bound and not

172
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,920
a lower bound.

173
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,750
In most of the cases when
you're coding something,

174
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,350
you don't really care
how well your program

175
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,650
can run if you're really lucky.

176
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,358
What you really care
about is how does it

177
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,620
run in the worst case?

178
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,897
Or how does it run
most of the time?

179
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:08,230
So suppose you're Google, and
you're writing your search

180
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,230
engine, and you have to return
the result to the user in 200

181
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,990
milliseconds.

182
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,290
Because they did a study
that shows that if you return

183
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,750
the result in 400
milliseconds, they

184
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,190
lose some number of users,
which means they lose

185
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,130
some number of billions a year.

186
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,550
So to them a guarantee that
their algorithms complete

187
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,820
in 200 milliseconds
is pretty important,

188
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,040
because it means a ton of money.

189
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,770
So if you have a running
time that looks like this,

190
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,280
that's OK, as long as
this is 200 milliseconds

191
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,900
for the number of pages
that Google indexes.

192
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,775
Does that make sense?

193
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:43,030


194
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,530
OK.

195
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,270
No answer means yes.

196
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,620
So if it doesn't make
sense, please say something.

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,240


198
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
OK, I will draw
another function.

199
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Again--

200
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,950
AUDIENCE: Victor?

201
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,790
VICTOR COSTAN: --wavy.

202
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,290
Yes?

203
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,910
AUDIENCE: It says x times 1
plus something [INAUDIBLE]..

204
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,630
So what?

205
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,950
VICTOR COSTAN: So it's--

206
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,867
AUDIENCE: Oh it's sin.

207
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,282
VICTOR COSTAN: 1 plus sin of x.

208
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:03,782
It--

209
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:05,000
AUDIENCE: It looks
like [INAUDIBLE]..

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,090
VICTOR COSTAN: Yeah.

211
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,784
Sorry, my handwriting
is not very good.

212
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:08,534
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

213
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,360
Mine isn't either.

214
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,860
VICTOR COSTAN: And
it doesn't really

215
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,290
matter what it is, it just needs
to be sin so that it looks wavy

216
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,820
like this.

217
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,180
AUDIENCE: OK.

218
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,360
VICTOR COSTAN: So that
I can make something

219
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,372
that looks complicated.

220
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:17,872
OK.

221
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:18,364
AUDIENCE: Got it.

222
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:19,840
AUDIENCE: I have
a question, too.

223
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,648
In the first example, is
it 1.2 times x squared?

224
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:24,440
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,720
I wanted something
that's higher than 1.1.

226
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,080
AUDIENCE: It's like [INAUDIBLE].

227
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,872
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

228
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:32,450


229
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:32,950
OK.

230
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,333
Now that I got a
break, does anyone else

231
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,250
want to ask questions?

232
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,480


233
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,900
OK.

234
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,828
So I'm going to draw
another function.

235
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,340
This one looks like this.

236
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:58,176
And this is f of x
equals 1 plus sin of x.

237
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:02,110
I have to use these signs
to make them look like that.

238
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,940
Times x to the power of--

239
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,880
What do I have there?

240
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:13,180
1 5 plus x to the
power of one fourth.

241
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,510
So for this function I know for
sure that it is greater than x

242
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,910
to the power of one fourth.

243
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,710
Right?

244
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,840
So if this is--

245
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,770


246
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,216
I know for sure that
it's greater than that.

247
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:32,440
Also if I look at this, and
I know that sin is never

248
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,100
bigger than 1, I know this
whole thing is going to be,

249
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,470
at most, 2.

250
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,020
So if I have another
function that

251
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:46,690
says f prime of x equals, say,
3 times x to the power of 1.5,

252
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,210
I know that it's going
to bound it from above.

253
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,480
So I have two bounds.

254
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,470
So it sort of looks
like this case.

255
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,540
Except when I use theta,
I have to make sure

256
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,220
that the bounds
are very similar.

257
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,690
They can only differ
by a constant factor.

258
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,290
In this case my bounds
differ by the exponent

259
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,330
here, which is more
than a constant factor,

260
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,810
so they're not the same.

261
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,210
So if I take my function--

262
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,634
which by the way is g--

263
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:20,360


264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:30,580
if I want to say that g to the x
is theta of something, I can't.

265
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,490
Because no matter
what I put in here,

266
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,790
it's not going to be correct.

267
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,290
The lower bound is this,
the upper bound is this.

268
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,180
But what I can do
is I can say that I

269
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,740
know for sure that it is theta
of x to the power one fourth.

270
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,070
And by the way I can
also say that it is order

271
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,240
of x to the power of one fifth.

272
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,180


273
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,100
So if you have weird running
times that looks like this,

274
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,600
then you can only
use O and omega.

275
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,220
And with that
being said, we will

276
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,210
use O for pretty much
the rest of this course.

277
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,610
And for most of the cases
we'll use it to mean theta.

278
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,960


279
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,110
Oh, by the way, these formulas
look ugly and complicated,

280
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,390
because I wanted the graphs to
look complicated to illustrate

281
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,440
the idea that asymptotic
notation makes

282
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,940
things look simpler.

283
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,440
In this course the running times
that you'll be dealing with

284
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,130
are all look like this.

285
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:45,800
They will either be order 1,
order log n, order n, order n

286
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,550
log n, n ordered n squared.

287
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,450
You might have one or two cases
where you get something else,

288
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,040
but most of the time if
you have something else

289
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,730
coming out of your occurrence,
it means you're doing it wrong.

290
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,080
So nice tip to have.

291
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
And you can see that I
already started doing it.

292
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm already using
O instead of theta.

293
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,670
So I guess I'm getting
into the habit.

294
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,664


295
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:15,575
AUDIENCE: So why did you leave
the theta one blank for g of x?

296
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:16,950
VICTOR COSTAN:
Because whatever I

297
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,790
put here is going to be wrong.

298
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,250
If I put x to the
power of one fifth,

299
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,730
this is wrong,
because I can have

300
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,020
an upper bound that has x to
the power of one fifth in it.

301
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,300
But I can't have a
lower bound like that,

302
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,030
because this function
hits x to the power of one

303
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,880
fourth in infinitely
many points.

304
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,910
If I try to do x to the power
of one fourth, same deal.

305
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,610
Lower bound yes, upper bound no.

306
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,670
So whatever I put in here
is going to be wrong.

307
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,220


308
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,030
Thank you.

309
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,698
Good question.

310
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:49,198
Yes?

311
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,108
AUDIENCE: Is that
1.4 or one fourth?

312
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:52,900
VICTOR COSTAN: 1.4.

313
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,850
They are 1.4 and 1.5

314
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,392
AUDIENCE: OK.

315
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,608
Because I thought you were
saying 1/4 and I was--

316
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:58,650
VICTOR COSTAN: Oh, sorry.

317
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,944
1 4, 1.4.

318
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:05,590
1.4, 1.5.

319
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,090
OK.

320
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,882
Are we good so far?

321
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:23,180


322
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,680
OK.

323
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,305
Let's go through a
couple of exercises.

324
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:26,730
So I'll give you
a few functions--

325
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,522
Yes?

326
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,730
AUDIENCE: Do you make omega--

327
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,570
Is that-- It's a lower
bound already without

328
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,480
multiplying by any
constant, or something?

329
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,990
Is that what it is?

330
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,190
VICTOR COSTAN: So
for all of these,

331
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,400
what you put here is the
simple, is the simple form.

332
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,090
So you're lower bound can
be this function multiplied

333
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,300
by any constant factor.

334
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,915
AUDIENCE: That-- So
omega means lower bound?

335
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,540
VICTOR COSTAN: Omega
means lower bound,

336
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,570
O means upper bound,
theta means both.

337
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,380


338
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,930
OK.

339
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,860
Any other things to clear
up before I ask questions?

340
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,530
So it's your turn
before it's my turn.

341
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,670


342
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,170
All right.

343
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm going to go over
a few functions,

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,220
and I want you guys
to tell me what--

345
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,520
to help me write them
in asymptotic notation.

346
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,230
So I will have f of n.

347
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,530
And I want to know
it's theta of what?

348
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,680
So let's start with f of
n equals 10 to the 80.

349
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,780
Does anyone know
why 10 to the 80?

350
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,140


351
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,640
Yes.

352
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,300
AUDIENCE: That'd be O of 1.

353
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,050
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

354
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,435
That's the correct answer.

355
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,560
You 're going ahead though.

356
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,750
I was wondering if--

357
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,750
I was wondering if you know why?

358
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,423
Why did I choose this?

359
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:51,840
Does anyone know
why I chose this?

360
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,340
Yes?

361
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,813
AUDIENCE: Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

362
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,230
VICTOR COSTAN: I
think that's 100.

363
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,098
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

364
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,890
VICTOR COSTAN: You're
getting close though.

365
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,787
It's something.

366
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,245
AUDIENCE: It's a
really big number.

367
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,310
VICTOR COSTAN: It's
a really big number.

368
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,810
All right.

369
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,190
So it's a really big number.

370
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,440
That's the estimated number
of atoms in the universe.

371
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,858
So realistically any
quantity that you

372
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,259
deal with that will
represent the real world,

373
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,839
is not going to be
bigger than this.

374
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,079
So if you want to get
all philosophical,

375
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,569
you can say that for
any algorithm that you

376
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,720
write in any realistic
input the running time

377
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,280
will be theta of 1.

378
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,848
But if you do this, we're not
going to be happy with you

379
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:27,967
on exams.

380
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,312
[LAUGHTER]

381
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,320


382
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,800
So let's choose another one.

383
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,460
20 n to the power of 7.

384
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,100


385
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,740
What's this an
asymptotic notation?

386
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,501
And why?

387
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:49,990


388
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,490
Yes?

389
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,550
AUDIENCE: Order O
of n to the seventh.

390
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,360
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

391
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,720
Of that same thing,
n to the seventh.

392
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,220
Thank you.

393
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,722
Why is that?

394
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:04,949
AUDIENCE: Because if you
distribute the exponent 7,

395
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,290
20 to the seventh is a constant.

396
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,570
VICTOR COSTAN: Excellent.

397
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,160
20 to the 7 time
n to the 7, this

398
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,600
is a constant so it goes away.

399
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,710


400
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,330
OK.

401
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,420
And before I do
another one, I want

402
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,780
to give you guys some help
and remind you about logs.

403
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,240
How many people
remember the laws

404
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,860
of working with logs from
algebra or some math class?

405
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,240


406
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,740
All right.

407
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,510
You guys will be helping me
write them for everyone else.

408
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,960
So if I have log
of n to the 100,

409
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
and I want to get to the theta
notation for it, what is it

410
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,190
and why?

411
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,330
AUDIENCE: Log n.

412
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,080
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

413
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,580
Excellent.

414
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,920


415
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,746
Why is that the case?

416
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:57,950
AUDIENCE: It's 100 log n.

417
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,700
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

418
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,380
So when I have an
exponent here, I

419
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,430
can pull it out in front of
the log as a constant factor.

420
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:10,470
So this is the same
thing as 100 log n.

421
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,970
OK.

422
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:19,810
Now if I have the logarithm to
the base using base 5 of n--

423
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,640
How about this?

424
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,412


425
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] multiply.

426
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,780
That's just log n?

427
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,610
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

428
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,560
So this is-- can
you say that again?

429
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,530
AUDIENCE: Log n.

430
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,280
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

431
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,260
So this is theta of
log n because it is--

432
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,360
AUDIENCE: Log n over log 5.

433
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,160
VICTOR COSTAN: So
that's log n over log 5.

434
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,190
So exponents inside
the logs turn

435
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,330
into constant factors, bases
turn into constant factors.

436
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,390
So if you have an ugly
expression inside a logarithm,

437
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,020
you can, most of the
time, simplify it

438
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,062
to something really nice.

439
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:04,390
And this contributes
to the fact that these

440
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,020
are the only functions
that you will

441
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,180
see when the answer is cleaned
up in asymptotic notation.

442
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,940


443
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,440
OK.

444
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,660
Yes?

445
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,202
AUDIENCE: So when
you're writing log,

446
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:18,452
are you assuming the
second base then?

447
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,660
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes, there
is a certain base for logs.

448
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,020
We're all computer scientists.

449
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,520
Right?

450
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,213
So what's the natural
base for our logarithms?

451
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,099
AUDIENCE: 2.

452
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,430
2D.

453
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,350
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

454
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,880
Sweet.

455
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,486
Math major?

456
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,780
AUDIENCE: No, you know I
always heard natural base--

457
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,530
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

458
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,800
Yeah, it's a math joke.

459
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,580
So for everyone else a natural
logarithm is in base E.

460
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,490
For us CS people, a
natural base is 2,

461
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,580
because that's how many
values you have for a bit.

462
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:54,820
So log means log n is
to log base 2 of n.

463
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,437


464
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,020
The good news is
that most of the time

465
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,645
we're working with
asymptotic notation,

466
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:01,840
so it doesn't really matter.

467
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,670
We can communicate
with our math friends,

468
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,370
and we don't have
to talk about this.

469
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,870
OK.

470
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,060
I need to get another
complicated example.

471
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,590
And my memory fails me.

472
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,518


473
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,018
OK.

474
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:22,450


475
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,200
So log-- See, I'm using
Ln to mean the math

476
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,850
natural logarithm.

477
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,075
So we still have that
somewhere in here.

478
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:39,570
Of log n to the base 100.

479
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,300
They made me add all these
parentheses in the last section

480
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,110
to be clear, so I'm adding
them now from the start.

481
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,790
Who wants to help
me clean this up?

482
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,800


483
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,496
Yes?

484
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:51,798
AUDIENCE: Log, log n.

485
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:52,840
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

486
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,940
Wow, one step.

487
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,200
Log, log n OK.

488
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,930
Can you tell me
why, very quickly?

489
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,347
AUDIENCE: So we can simplify
out the base and the exponent

490
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:08,847
in there.

491
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:09,663
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

492
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,330
AUDIENCE: Then--

493
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,538
VICTOR COSTAN: Base goes out.

494
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,880
Exponent goes out.

495
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,177
AUDIENCE: Log, log of something
is another classic complexity.

496
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:17,260
It's not exactly up there.

497
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,745
But can you--

498
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,537
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

499
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,170
AUDIENCE:
--occassionally useful.

500
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,470
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

501
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,680
What does a theory student
say when they're drowning?

502
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,720


503
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,090
Log, log, log, log.

504
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,210
Some of you are laughing
already, because know this.

505
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,710
OK.

506
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,900
What if I want to make
this a little bit harder?

507
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:45,752
And I say log [INAUDIBLE]
5 of log n to the 100.

508
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,210
You have to do a
bit more work now,

509
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,002
you can't just use the
tricks on the right.

510
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:53,470


511
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,980
Anyone else?

512
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,490
Yes?

513
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,930
AUDIENCE: It's still log, log n.

514
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,680
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

515
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,545
It is still log, log n.

516
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,670
But for a different reason.

517
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,294
Right?

518
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:04,650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

519
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,010
VICTOR COSTAN: Almost.

520
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,690
OK.

521
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,510
Maybe not.

522
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,270
So the base still goes
out just like before.

523
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,920
But this guy now goes out here.

524
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,805
So I will have this
be, sort of like--

525
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,180
Notice that I'm
not saying equal,

526
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,590
I'm saying like because
I got rid of the base.

527
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:39,790
So it's like 100 times log
n, which is log 100 plus log,

528
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,780
log n.

529
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,750


530
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,040
And this is a constant
factor, this grows as n grows.

531
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,740
So this is going to
become incredibly small

532
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,960
as n becomes larger and
larger, so I can get rid of it.

533
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,980


534
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,480
OK?

535
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,720


536
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,730
OK.

537
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,010
One more, and this one's
going to be less boring.

538
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,979
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] out into a
separate term-- the log of 100?

539
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,046
Going from it in
the last step, how

540
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:12,090
are you able to cross that out?

541
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,740
VICTOR COSTAN: If my memory--

542
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:21,017
If my memory works, I think,
log of a b is log a plus log b.

543
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:21,725
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

544
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:22,965
VICTOR COSTAN: Am I right guys?

545
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:23,465
Sweet.

546
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:29,620


547
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,770
Good question.

548
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,010
I wasn't sure, but
now that you asked,

549
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,340
everyone else helped me
make sure it's right.

550
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:43,790


551
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,290
OK.

552
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,957
I'm erasing so much,
because we're going

553
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:47,940
to need more room for this.

554
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,090
So I have a log again, but this
time what I have inside the log

555
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,790
is n choose n over 2.

556
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,730
Does any brave soul want to come
up here and solve this for me?

557
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:08,135


558
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:08,635
No?

559
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:12,320


560
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,963
You guys are going to make
me write for the entire hour?

561
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,895
[LAUGHTER]

562
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,793


563
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:23,160
VICTOR COSTAN: I'll offer help.

564
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,128
AUDIENCE: It's n--

565
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,405
[INAUDIBLE]

566
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,530
VICTOR COSTAN: So this is--

567
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,608
AUDIENCE: Is that
n factorial over --

568
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:29,400
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

569
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,980
AUDIENCE: --n divided
by 2 factorial?

570
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,250
VICTOR COSTAN: n factorial
over n divided by 2 factorial,

571
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,120
times n divided by 2 factorial.

572
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,620
Close.

573
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,250


574
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,170
And I'll give up
another hint, which

575
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,950
is that n factorial
can be approximated

576
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,420
as square root of 2pi n
multiplied by n over E divided

577
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,070
by n to the power of n.

578
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,870
But I think this will
make you guys not

579
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,460
want to come up and solve this.

580
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,082
Yes?

581
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:02,624
AUDIENCE: OK.

582
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,124
[INAUDIBLE]

583
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:05,970


584
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,210
VICTOR COSTAN: I was--

585
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,120
Is that it?

586
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,490
Is that not it?

587
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,170
Did I get it wrong?

588
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:12,886
OK.

589
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:16,540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] minus n.

590
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,890
VICTOR COSTAN: I think
that's an asymptotic.

591
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,260
That's what we'll-- I
think we'll get to that.

592
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,775
But factorials
grow exponentially.

593
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:26,450


594
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,200
So it should be
something like this.

595
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,700
OK.

596
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,210
So we have that
nice approximation.

597
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,680
Does anyone want to work it
out, or will I have to do it?

598
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,774


599
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:41,350
I'll keep that in mind when
I'm grading your homework.

600
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,480
[LAUGHTER]

601
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,230
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

602
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:53,390
So it's log of square root 2
pi n multiplied by n over 2

603
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,750
to the power of n.

604
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,140
I'm going to put
these two together.

605
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,345
So 2 pi n over--

606
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:06,720
There's an n over
2 there, right?

607
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:16,780
So it's n over 2E times n
over 2 to the power of 2.

608
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:22,990


609
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,330
OK, I can get rid of this
guy, because it's a constant.

610
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,760
I can get--

611
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,805
No, I can't get rid
of this guy yet.

612
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:35,605
AUDIENCE: In the denominator
shouldn't it be 2pi n over 2

613
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:37,980
under the radical?

614
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,450
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

615
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,330
2pi n over 2, so
this simplifies.

616
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,230
OK.

617
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,750
Thank you.

618
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,250
AUDIENCE: Square
at the bottom term,

619
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,100
you can get rid of the
square root on the end--

620
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,050
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

621
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,830
AUDIENCE: --and then cancel
the some of the exponents.

622
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,580
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

623
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,747
Do you want to come help me?

624
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:56,490
AUDIENCE: Sure.

625
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,740
VICTOR COSTAN: Thanks so much.

626
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:05,884


627
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,384
STUDENT: OK.

628
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,680
So we can distribute this
exponent here to cancel this.

629
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:19,898
And then we get square root
of pi n times n over 2.

630
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,167
And it'd be n-- sorry
about my handwriting.

631
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,000
VICTOR COSTAN: I think
it's better than mine

632
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,760
by quite a bit.

633
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,485
STUDENT: Square root of pi n.

634
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,960
And this is square root
squared, so that cancels .

635
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,405


636
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:44,365
Times n over E to the n.

637
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:49,315


638
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:51,702
AUDIENCE: Do you need
parenthesis around n over 2E?

639
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:52,285
STUDENT: Yeah.

640
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:54,265
That's probably good.

641
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,450
So, since this is n over E
to the n, and n over 2E n.

642
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,210
Well since they're
to the n, both the

643
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,140
n we can give them a single
exponent and cancel stuff.

644
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:13,910
So we just get square root
of pi n to the times 2

645
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,520
the n, over pi n.

646
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,892


647
00:29:22,892 --> 00:29:27,822
Can do some more cancelling
and just get 2 the n over--

648
00:29:27,822 --> 00:29:30,666


649
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:36,995
Going to simplify this to the
n over the square root of n.

650
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:39,920
We can take out the pi, because
it's in our natural logarithm.

651
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,660
It's a constant factor.

652
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,050
And this is log of--

653
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,165


654
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:56,960
and then-- Since it's a log of,
it's just log of 2 to the n.

655
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:09,236
So it's-- say since it's log
you can turn it into log of 2

656
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:13,070
to the n minus log
of square root of n.

657
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,180
Log of 2 to the n is a
much greater complexity

658
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,270
than square root
of n, so we can--

659
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,173
VICTOR COSTAN: Sweet.

660
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:20,290
Thank you.

661
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,140
So see?

662
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,510
Complicated formula-- Even
more complicated formula

663
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,370
came out to be
one of the numbers

664
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,260
that I promised it
would come out to.

665
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,470
Thanks for the help.

666
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,320
So you can get rid of the
pi as soon as you want to.

667
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,120
And this is the last step.

668
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,550
I just want to
say it again, just

669
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,020
make sure everyone heard it.

670
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:46,750
So once you get here, you
get this, order n minus log

671
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,935
of square root of n, which is--

672
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:56,460


673
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:07,130
This is-- This is order
n minus one half log n.

674
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,880
And the log n is
much smaller than n,

675
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,377
so this goes away completely.

676
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:13,960
And you get this as
your final answer.

677
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,450


678
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:20,950
OK.

679
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,825
Does this make sense?

680
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:27,230


681
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,420
Any questions?

682
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,320
Anyone?

683
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,210
How many people are still
paying attention honestly?

684
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,130
Wow.

685
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,532
Nice.

686
00:31:36,532 --> 00:31:37,990
You should come to
all my sections.

687
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:59,890


688
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,390
OK.

689
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,410
Let's talk about something
we covered in class.

690
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,820
Let's talk about peak finding.

691
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,560
And we'll start with
1D peak finding,

692
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,000
and then we'll go
to 2D peak finding.

693
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,315
So does anyone remember the
pseudocode for the faster 1D

694
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:12,440
peak finding by any chance?

695
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,560


696
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,660
ID peak finding.

697
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,220


698
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,270
I think everyone said
they went to lecture,

699
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,580
so I don't have to explain
what peak finding is, right?

700
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,460


701
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:30,960
OK.

702
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,870
So that's go for it.

703
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,320
So suppose I have
a few numbers--

704
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
3-- let me write this one--

705
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:48,370
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4.

706
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,890
So the peak finding problem says
there's an array of numbers,

707
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,610
and I want to find
the local peak.

708
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,720
And the local peak
is a number that's

709
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,040
surrounded by numbers that
are smaller or equal to it.

710
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,720
So there shouldn't be any
larger numbers than it.

711
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,355
And I want to find a
peak as quickly as I can.

712
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,480
So what's the faster
algorithm that we talked about

713
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,980
in lecture?

714
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,730


715
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,370
Yes?

716
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:18,870
OK.

717
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,378
You didn't answer, right,
as much, at least so.

718
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:23,390
AUDIENCE: Binary search?

719
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,140
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

720
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,840
It's exactly like binary search.

721
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,270
Yep.

722
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,740
Do you wanna help me
write the pseudocode?

723
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,089
You can tell me what it is.

724
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:31,714
AUDIENCE: Sure.

725
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:34,290
So, I guess well
start in the middle.

726
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,040
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

727
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,550


728
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,310
Start in the middle.

729
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,930


730
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,333
If you-- If you write
this on your Pset

731
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,250
you might want to be a
little bit more formal.

732
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,410
Someone asked about proofs.

733
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,730
I would say
something like, start

734
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,500
by looking at the middle
element of the array.

735
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,530
Same thing though.

736
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,640
OK.

737
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,160
So let's pretend
this is the middle.

738
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,480
Now it is.

739
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,568
What do I do?

740
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:09,870
AUDIENCE: Then you can check
one side in the middle.

741
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,719
So it's [INAUDIBLE]
the right side.

742
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,469
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

743
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,982
I'm looking at the right side.

744
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,250
I see a 7 there,
so I know for sure

745
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,760
that this is not a local peak.

746
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,389
Right?

747
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,467
What do I do now?

748
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:26,703
AUDIENCE: So now you can
start over, and using 7.

749
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:27,659
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

750
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,560
What if-- This would be small.

751
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,900
What if I would look at 5 first?

752
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,860
Or you should I look
at the other side too?

753
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,483
AUDIENCE: Well you don't have
to in this case, but if you--

754
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:40,897
But if 7 were smaller
then you would

755
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:42,768
go and look at the
other side, and check

756
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,109
to see if 5 is also smaller.

757
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,580
In that case you've
already found the peak.

758
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,330
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

759
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,500
So I have to look at both
sides and make sure--

760
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,380
if none of them is
smaller, than I--

761
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,929
I'm sorry.

762
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,989
If none of them is
bigger, I found the peak.

763
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:00,340
If any of them is bigger then
I can go whichever way I want.

764
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,990
So I saw my 7, I'm going
to cut this in half.

765
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,652
And now I look at this.

766
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:06,610
You were saying, right?

767
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,650


768
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,658
So look at the neighbors--

769
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:14,700
By the way, can anyone
understand my handwriting?

770
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,830
Is it even worth
bothering to write?

771
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,090
AUDIENCE: It's pretty good.

772
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,160
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

773
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,060
I see three nods.

774
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm going to write for
those three people.

775
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,680
AUDIENCE: It's just
we haven't taken

776
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,858
any cursive in about 12 years.

777
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:29,830
So--

778
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,580
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

779
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,560
Thanks.

780
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,590
Not feeling well at all.

781
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,345
OK look at neighbors,
figure out if you're a peak.

782
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,470
You're one of the people
that said you can read it,

783
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,420
so now there's only two people
that can read my handwriting

784
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,140
and that I like.

785
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,180
[LAUGHTER]

786
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,110
VICTOR COSTAN: Look
at the neighbors.

787
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,540
See if local peak.

788
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,280


789
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,160
And if not, figure out
which way to go in.

790
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,080


791
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,850
And I'll say if not recurse.

792
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,740


793
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,930
So what's the running
time for this?

794
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,250
Suppose I have n
elements to start with,

795
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,660
that's my array size.

796
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,583
I will use t of n
as my running time.

797
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,000
So to figure out the running
time for the whole algorithm,

798
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,890
I have to look at the
running time for each step

799
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,660
and add them up.

800
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,100
Right?

801
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,010
What's the running time
for the first step?

802
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,940
Looking in the middle.

803
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,350


804
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the middle elements.

805
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,520
VICTOR COSTAN: 1.

806
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,020
1.

807
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,610
I would not say 0.

808
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,900
I still have to look at it.

809
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,940
Or to be on the safe side
you say 1, theta of 1.

810
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,530
It's a constant.

811
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,030
OK.

812
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,530
Now I have to look
at the neighbors,

813
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,150
and I have to see if one
of them is bigger or not.

814
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,030
How about that?

815
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,118
How much time is left?

816
00:36:57,118 --> 00:37:00,050


817
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,440
I heard the constant.

818
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,670
OK.

819
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,430
Very soft voice, but I
heard a constant there,

820
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,820
so I'm going to take it.

821
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,253
So this guy is a constant.

822
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:12,670
If it's a local,
if you come down.

823
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,750
If it's not a local peak, what's
the running time for this?

824
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:22,146


825
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,622
n over 2, since--

826
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:25,708


827
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,250
AUDIENCE: If you FOIL that you
divide by [INAUDIBLE],, right?

828
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,180
VICTOR COSTAN: Yep.

829
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,810
So I'm looking at this guy.

830
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,915
It's clearly not a peak.

831
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:34,540
So I'm going to look
on the right side,

832
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,330
because I see a 7 here
that's bigger than a 6.

833
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,590
So now I have the same problem,
except my array size just

834
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,290
dropped to half.

835
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,390
So same problem, because I
already have a name for it,

836
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,110
except the input
size is different.

837
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:56,130
So the running time for this
entire step is theta of 1

838
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,540
plus T of n over 2.

839
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,935
So the running time for
the whole thing is--

840
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:05,200


841
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,770
I should have said
theta of 1 here, sorry.

842
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,890
So theta of 1 plus theta
of 1 plus T of n over 2.

843
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:22,460
So this is theta 1
plus T of n over 2.

844
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,980
So I wrote out my pseudocode,
looked at the running time

845
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,460
for each step, added them up.

846
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,630
Now I have a recurrence,
and I have to solve it.

847
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,460
Let's solve it.

848
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,450
We sort of glossed
over that in lectures,

849
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,980
so we're going to do it now.

850
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:46,150


851
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,620
So T of n equals theta
of 1 plus T of n over 2.

852
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,220
I'm going to expand this
using the definition.

853
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,840
And theta of one is long, so I'm
going to call this c instead.

854
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,060
It's a constant, right?

855
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,600
So c plus-- expanding this--

856
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,510
c plus T of n over 4.

857
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,080
I'm going to expand it again.

858
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,670


859
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:25,530
And again-- Anyone
getting bored of this?

860
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:31,020
So if I expand it a lot of
times, I'm going to get i times

861
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,912
c, plus T of n
divided by 2 to the n.

862
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:37,370
And you can expand
it as many times

863
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,120
as you want until
we see the pattern,

864
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,950
but this is the pattern.

865
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,200
So I have a recurrence.

866
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,770
What else do I need in
order to get a function?

867
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,335
I need a base case.

868
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,710
So the problem size gets
smaller and smaller and smaller,

869
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,130
but at some point
it becomes so small

870
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,080
that I can solve it
just by looking at it.

871
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,930
What's that case?

872
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

873
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:00,400


874
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,150
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

875
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,250
So if I have an array of
one element, it's a peak.

876
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:04,910
Right?

877
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,410
Job done.

878
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,210


879
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:15,970
So T of 1 is a constant.

880
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,350
So I want to write this in such
a way that this becomes this.

881
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:28,840
So I want to figure
out an i such that--

882
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,680
Yeah.

883
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,770
T of n divided by 2 to
the i equals T of 1.

884
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,240
And the easiest way of doing
that is to say that n divided

885
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,660
by 2 to the i is 1.

886
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,270
So i is the inverse
of an exponential--

887
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:48,770
Anyone?

888
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,544


889
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:53,450
AUDIENCE: Log n.

890
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,950
VICTOR COSTAN:
Logarithm, thank you.

891
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,570


892
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,470
Log n.

893
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,250
So I have i, and I'm going
to plug it back in here.

894
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:15,120
And I get constant times log
n, plus T of 1, which I know

895
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,390
is theta of 1.

896
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,560


897
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,670
I'm going to make
this theta of 1 again.

898
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:28,900
So theta of 1 times
log n, plus theta of 1.

899
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,870
And I know that log n
dominates a constant,

900
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,760
so this is going to
be theta of log n.

901
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,655


902
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:41,155
Solved.

903
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:45,260


904
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,760
OK.

905
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,130
How are we doing?

906
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,750
Yes?

907
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,435
AUDIENCE: In the second
to last from the bottom,

908
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:55,604
I don't understand
[INAUDIBLE] of c times log n

909
00:41:55,604 --> 00:41:58,019
replace i by log n.

910
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:02,350
In the second part of the
equation, how did you--

911
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,100
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

912
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,810
So in the jump
from here to here,

913
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,362
where I said i equals log n--

914
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:08,862
Right?

915
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,510
AUDIENCE: Yep.

916
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,660
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

917
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,990
So i becomes log n, c stays c.

918
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,750
You're wondering about
this part, right?

919
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,400
So if i is log n,
then 2 to the i is n.

920
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,660
So I have T of 1,
which I have here.

921
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,150
So I want this to
have this happen.

922
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,725
When I'm solving for i here, I
set this guy to my base case,

923
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,100
so that I can get
this to happen.

924
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,030


925
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,093
The idea here is that you're
expanding the recursion

926
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,760
forever, and you know
that at some point

927
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,890
you're going to have to stop.

928
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,540
When do you stop?

929
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,630
You stop at the base case.

930
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,208
So you force this to
become the base case.

931
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:54,576


932
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:56,395
OK?

933
00:42:56,395 --> 00:42:56,895
OK.

934
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:02,440


935
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,650
Let's do 2D peak finding.

936
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,040
Let's talk about
it a little bit.

937
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:17,350


938
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,420
So 2D peak finding is
exactly like 1D peak finding,

939
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:27,020
except you have a 2D matrix
instead of a 1D array.

940
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,610
Let's see if I
can do this right.

941
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:49,980


942
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,210
So suppose this is our matrix.

943
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,910
And suppose these are the rows.

944
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:05,600
Suppose we have m
rows and n columns.

945
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:22,940


946
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,580
Can anyone remind me what
the psuedocode for 2D

947
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,260
peak finding that we
talked about in lecture?

948
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,550
So we had two attempts.

949
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,110
The first one was
a clear failure.

950
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,440
It didn't work.

951
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,350
The second one worked.

952
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,200
And we talked about its
running time a little bit.

953
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,390
And then Srini asked you
to think of a variation

954
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,630
to the second one.

955
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,720
So let's do those
straight up second version

956
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,490
of the pseudocode
without the variation.

957
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,570
So 2D peak finding.

958
00:44:49,570 --> 00:45:00,433


959
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:01,350
What is the algorithm?

960
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:07,680


961
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,180
All right.

962
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,220
One person was not asleep in my
section at the end of lecture.

963
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,104
I'm proud.

964
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:13,646
AUDIENCE: OK.

965
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:15,128
Well, Which one of us?

966
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:16,633
We both spoke at the same time.

967
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,675
VICTOR COSTAN: You had
your hand up first though.

968
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,590
AUDIENCE: So you just pick
a middle of the column.

969
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,448
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

970
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:24,876
And then you find
the peak there.

971
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:29,170


972
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,292
AUDIENCE: And then you shift
the neighbors, I think.

973
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:42,686
VICTOR COSTAN: Find
peak neighbors.

974
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:46,630
AUDIENCE: Neighbors
in the same room?

975
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,408
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

976
00:45:48,408 --> 00:45:50,450
VICTOR COSTAN: That's the
horizontal line, right?

977
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:50,950
OK.

978
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,788
So what do you mean
by find the peak here?

979
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:57,600
AUDIENCE: Like
within the column?

980
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,392
VICTOR COSTAN: Yes.

981
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,290
So find the peak using what
we talked about before?

982
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

983
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,990
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

984
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,600


985
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:10,770
Find 1D peak.

986
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,570


987
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,650
So you're thinking ahead.

988
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,090
You're thinking of the
variation that Srini asked you

989
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,600
guys to think about at home.

990
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,850
I'm glad you thought about it.

991
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,060
That's good.

992
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,262
But what's the one
that we had in lecture?

993
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:26,470
I don't want to think about--

994
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,345
I don't want to give
you guys the answer yet.

995
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:32,110
So what did we say we were
going to do in lecture?

996
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,767
Yes?

997
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:35,202
AUDIENCE: I think we
just picked a spot,

998
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:37,130
checked the neighbors
and kept walking uphill.

999
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,856
That makes sense.

1000
00:46:38,856 --> 00:46:41,590
Every time we found a
neighbor that was bigger,

1001
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,910
we moved to that spot.

1002
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,508
Checked its neighbors.

1003
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:45,800
VICTOR COSTAN: So this is the--

1004
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,430
This is the first
algorithm that's slow.

1005
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,025
It works.

1006
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:50,650
You're going to get
the correct answer.

1007
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,530
But it's slow because if you
have some handily crafted

1008
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,570
matrix you can go like
this, and you're basically

1009
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,400
going through the whole matrix.

1010
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,600
Yes?

1011
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,088
AUDIENCE: I think there's like
an algorithm that's find a--

1012
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,755
look through the
column for its maximum,

1013
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:08,300
and then look to either side.

1014
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,100
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

1015
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,940
So instead of finding
a 1D peak, we're

1016
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,825
going to find the maximum value.

1017
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:16,160


1018
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,660
OK.

1019
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,480
And this is correct, and let's
look at its running time.

1020
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,033


1021
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:26,200
Does anyone want to help me?

1022
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:32,050
So this is T of n m.

1023
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,550
Right?

1024
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,550
Then rows, then columns.

1025
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,280


1026
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,050
So what's the running
time for the first step?

1027
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:39,870
Come on.

1028
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,030
This is the easy one.

1029
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,390
Yes?

1030
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,950
The constant.

1031
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:43,450
Perfect.

1032
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,180


1033
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,740
OK.

1034
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,650
What's the running
time for finding

1035
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,087
a maximum amount of n numbers?

1036
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:53,460
AUDIENCE: n.

1037
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,000
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

1038
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,830
Perfect.

1039
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,820
And suppose we do that here?

1040
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,950
Suppose these rows don't exist.

1041
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,130
Suppose this is
my entire matrix.

1042
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,230
And I'm here, and I
found the maximum.

1043
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,180
What do I do?

1044
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,200
I look left, I look right.

1045
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,450
If both of them are
smaller, then it

1046
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,750
means I found my peak,
because I know that number

1047
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,960
was a maximum in my column.

1048
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,290
Now if that's not the case, if
I find a number that's bigger,

1049
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,330
I'll go in that direction.

1050
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,290
Does that sound reasonable?

1051
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:28,790
OK.

1052
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,660
So maximum for my column,
and I'm going to go right.

1053
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,680
So check neighbors, and I have
the same two conditions there.

1054
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,020


1055
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,325
If it's a peak, then I'm happy.

1056
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:45,100


1057
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,430
Otherwise recurse.

1058
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,850
So what's the running
time if I have to recurse?

1059
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,520
How does the new
problem look like?

1060
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,660


1061
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,800
It's an identical problem.

1062
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,770
I still have a matrix, except--

1063
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,450
What changed?

1064
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,260
So suppose I got here--

1065
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,840
and this is the
middle of my matrix--

1066
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,810
and I see that
this guy is bigger,

1067
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,950
so I'm going to recurse
to the right side.

1068
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,725
What happened to
my problem size?

1069
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:17,590


1070
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,090
OK?

1071
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,090
AUDIENCE: Sorry I'm not
answering your question,

1072
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,392
but shouldn't find x
be theta of m, not n?

1073
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:24,308
Is that m?

1074
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:24,850
I can't tell.

1075
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,320
VICTOR COSTAN: Let me see.

1076
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,710
AUDIENCE: I can't tell

1077
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,710
VICTOR COSTAN: You are right.

1078
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,380
Thank you for paying attention.

1079
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,920
Theta m.

1080
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,480
Sweet.

1081
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,980
That would have
tripped me up later.

1082
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,650
Thanks for saving me.

1083
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,098
AUDIENCE: OK.

1084
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,181
So what was your question?

1085
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,125
Sorry.

1086
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,500
VICTOR COSTAN: So the question
is, if I have to recurse--

1087
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,460
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

1088
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,168
VICTOR COSTAN: --what's
the running time?

1089
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:46,800


1090
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,100
So I'm-- If I have to recurse,
I'm in this array that was

1091
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,500
originally n by m, and I'm
only going to look at the right

1092
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,000
side.

1093
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,310


1094
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:06,110
How many these-- how many rows
do I have in the new array?

1095
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,584
Start to the easy one.

1096
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:09,298
AUDIENCE: m.

1097
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,340
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

1098
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,010
Same as before.

1099
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,340
How many columns?

1100
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,210
AUDIENCE: n over 2.

1101
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,210
VICTOR COSTAN: n over 2.

1102
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,820


1103
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,300
Sweet.

1104
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,090
So there recursion
for this is theta of 1

1105
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:32,830
plus theta of m plus
T of n over 2 and m.

1106
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,350


1107
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,870
I know that a constant can be
absorbed by this other guy,

1108
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:47,122
so it's theta of m
plus T of n over 2 m.

1109
00:50:47,122 --> 00:50:48,080
How would I solve this?

1110
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,370


1111
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,870
What's the first
thing that we need?

1112
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,380


1113
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:58,880
Yes?

1114
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,620
AUDIENCE: Need to figure
out the base case.

1115
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,180
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

1116
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,540
Excellent.

1117
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:01,950
Base case.

1118
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:02,730
What's the best--

1119
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:03,688
What was the base case?

1120
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:08,400


1121
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,866
AUDIENCE: T of 1
comma T of n-- m.

1122
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:11,597
Sorry.

1123
00:51:11,597 --> 00:51:12,430
VICTOR COSTAN: Nice.

1124
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,850
AUDIENCE: Equal to O of m.

1125
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,290


1126
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,040
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.

1127
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,260


1128
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,020
Sweet.

1129
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,980
So if I only have one
column, then I can do--

1130
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,770
I can find the maximum
and I know for sure

1131
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:29,880
that's going to be a peak.

1132
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,060
Job done.

1133
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,990
That's my base case.

1134
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,680
So I'm going to reduce
the problem size in half,

1135
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,240
until I get to a single column.

1136
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,800
Then I find the peak
there, and I'm happy.

1137
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,298
How would I solve
this recurrence?

1138
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:46,552


1139
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:48,010
It's a one minute
answer, because I

1140
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,245
think that's exactly how
much time we have, as a hint.

1141
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:57,680


1142
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,485
Come on guys, this
looks familiar.

1143
00:51:59,485 --> 00:51:59,985
Yes?

1144
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:01,905
AUDIENCE:Going to be something
like the recurrence over

1145
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:02,390
there--

1146
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,348
VICTOR COSTAN: Exactly.

1147
00:52:03,348 --> 00:52:04,782
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of just n.

1148
00:52:04,782 --> 00:52:05,740
VICTOR COSTAN: Exactly.

1149
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,230
m never changes, right?

1150
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,990
So this is basically
a function of n.

1151
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,280
So if m never changes, and I
pretend that it's a constant,

1152
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,410
this looks exactly
like the recursion--

1153
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,340
the recurrence that
we solve before.

1154
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:22,920
T of n is a constant,
plus T of n over 2.

1155
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,000


1156
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,770
So I'm going to
get that constant,

1157
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,380
multiply it by log n, which is
the solution that I had before.

1158
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:42,210
So the running time
is theta of m log n.

1159
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:42,710
All right.

1160
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,090
I think I have 30 seconds,
so what if I would choose--

1161
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,870
What if I would try to do
this algorithm instead?

1162
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,740
It's another one
minute question.

1163
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
So I guess I'm cheating.

1164
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,280
I'm taking time away.

1165
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,220
Sorry.

1166
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,170
So what if I would
be finding a 1D peak

1167
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,557
instead of finding a maximum?

1168
00:52:58,557 --> 00:53:01,315


1169
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:03,940
I'm looking at the running time,
because if the running time is

1170
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,023
going to be the same, it's
not even worth thinking

1171
00:53:06,023 --> 00:53:07,400
if it's correct or not.

1172
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,950
If it's a more
complicated algorithm

1173
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,350
with the same running
time, why care about it?

1174
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,900
So is the running time
going to be better?

1175
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,400
OK.

1176
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,900
I heard a nod.

1177
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,094
Why?

1178
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,588
AUDIENCE: Won't it
be log m times log n?

1179
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:20,630
VICTOR COSTAN: All right.

1180
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,240
So 1D peak is exactly
what we have there.

1181
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,380
Thank you.

1182
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,230
1D peak is exactly
like you said, log m.

1183
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,480
So this constant here
becomes this constant here,

1184
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,550
so the algorithm
would be a lot faster.

1185
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,660
As an order of magnitude idea,
if your m and n are one million

1186
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,900
each, then log n is 20.

1187
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,290
So that's a 50 time
max improvement.

1188
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,900
And these are real input
sizes you might get.

1189
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,520
And that's it.

1190
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,530
Thank you guys.
