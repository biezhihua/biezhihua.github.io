# Lesson 43 Over the South Pole 

## 中文

飞越南极

美国探险家 R.E. 伯德在飞越北极3年之后，于1929年第一次飞越了南极。

虽然开始时伯德和他的助手们拍下了飞机下面连绵群山的大量照片，但他们很快就陷入了困境。

在有个地方，飞机似乎肯定要坠毁了。

只有在飞至10,000英尺的高度时，它才能飞过这些山头。

伯德马上命令他的助手们把两个沉重的食物袋扔掉。

于是飞机可以上升了，它在离山头400英尺的高度飞越了过去。

伯德这时知道他能够顺利飞抵300英里以外的南极了，因为前面再没有山了。

飞机可以毫无困难地飞过这片茫茫无际的白色原野！
