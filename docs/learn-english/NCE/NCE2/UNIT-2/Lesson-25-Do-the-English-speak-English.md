# Lesson 25 Do the English speak English?

## 中文

我终于到了伦敦。

火车站很大，又黑又暗。

我不知道去饭店的路该怎么走，于是向一个搬运工打听。

我的英语讲得不但非常认真，而且咬字也非常清楚。

然而搬运工却不明白我的话。

我把问话重复了很多遍。他终于听懂了。

他回答了，但他讲得既不慢也不清楚。

“我是个外国人，”我说。

于是他说得慢了，可我还是听不懂。我的老师从来不那样讲英语！

我和搬运工相视一笑。

接着，他说了点什么，这回我听懂了。

“您会很快学会英语的！”他说。

我感到奇怪。在英国，人们各自说着一种不同的语言。

英国人之间相互听得懂，可我却不懂他们的话！

他们说的是英语吗？

## 英文

I arrived in London at last **[lɑːst]**.

The railway station was big, black and dark.

I did not know the way to my hotel **[həʊˈtel]** , so I asked a porter **[ˈpɔːtə(r)]**.

I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well.

The porter, however, could not understand me. 

I repeated my question several times and at last he understood **[ˌʌndəˈstʊd]**.

He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.

"I am a foreigner" I said.

Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that!

The porter and I looked **[lʊkt]** at each other and smiled.

Then he said something and I understood it.

"You'll soon learn English" he said.

I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language.

The English understand each other, but I don't understand them!.

Do they speak English?
