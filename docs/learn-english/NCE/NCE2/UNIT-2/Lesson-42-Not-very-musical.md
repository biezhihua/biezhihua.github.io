# Lesson 42 Not very musical 

## 中文

并非很懂音乐

当我们穿过旧德里的市场时走了很长一段路，我们在一个广场上停下来休息。

过了一会儿，我们注意到广场的那一边有一个带着两个大筐的耍蛇人，于是就走过去看看。

他一见我们，就拿起了一个长长的上面镶有硬币的管乐器，并掀开了一个筐的盖子。

当他开始吹奏一支曲子时，我们才第一次看到那条蛇。

它从筐里探出身子，随着乐器的摆动而扭动。

当耍蛇人突然又吹奏起爵士乐和现代流行乐曲时，我们感到非常惊奇。

然而那蛇却还是缓慢地“舞动”着。

显然，它分辨不出印度音乐和爵士乐！

## 英文

As we had had a long walk **[wɔːk]** through one of the markets[ˈmɑrkɪt] of Old Delhi **[ˈdeli]**, we stopped **[stɒpt]** at a square **[skweə(r)]** to have a rest.

After a time, we noticed a snake **[sneɪk]** charmer **[ˈtʃɑːmə(r)]** with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him.

As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe **[paɪp]** which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets.

When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake.

It rose **[rəʊz]** out of the basket **[ˈbɑːskɪt]** and began to follow the movements of the pipe **[paɪp]**.

We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs[sɔːŋz].

The snake, however, continued to 'dance' **[dɑːns]** slowly.

It obviously **[ˈɒbviəsli]** could not tell the difference between Indian **[ˈɪndiən]** music and jazz!
