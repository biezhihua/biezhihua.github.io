# Lesson 47 A thirsty ghost 

## 中文

嗜酒的鬼魂

伊恩.汤普森先生最近才买的一个小酒店现在又要卖出去。

汤普森先生之所以想卖它，是因为那里常闹鬼。

他告诉我有天夜里他怎么也睡不着，因为他听到酒吧里传来一阵奇怪的响声。

第二天早上，他发现酒吧间的门被椅子堵上了，家具也被挪动过。

虽然汤普森临睡觉时把灯关了，但早晨灯却都亮着。

他还说他发现了5只空的威士忌瓶子，肯定是鬼魂昨天晚上喝的。

当我暗示说一定是村里有些人来喝不花钱的酒时，汤普森先生摇了摇头。

村里的人已经告诉他，即使他把小酒店白送人，他们也不要。
