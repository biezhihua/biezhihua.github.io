# Lesson 48 Did you want to tell me something? 

## 中文

你想对我说什么吗？

牙科医生们总是在你无法作出回答的时候向你提出问题。

我的牙科医生刚刚给我拔掉了一颗牙，叫我休息一会儿。

我想说点什么，但我嘴里塞满了药棉。

他知道我收集火柴盒，于是问我收藏的米柴盒是否在增加。

接着他又问我的兄弟近来如何，问我是否喜欢伦敦的新工作。

作为对这些问题的回答，我不是点头，就是发出奇怪的声音。

与此同时，我的舌头正在忙着寻找刚拔掉的那颗牙的伤口。

我突然非常着急起来，但却什么也说不出来。

当那位牙医最后将药棉从我嘴中取出时，我总算有可能告诉他，他拔错了牙。

        - Dentists `[subject]`
        - always `[frequently adverb]`
        - ask `[predicate verb phrase]` 
        - questions `[object]`
    - when it is impossible for you to answer.
        - when + clause `[adverbial clause of time]`
        - it `[subject]`
        - is `[be verb]`
        - impossible `[predicative]`
        - for you to answer `[adverbial of purpose]`

        - It + be. + [possible/impossible] + (for + sb.) + to + do. + (sth.) 这对某人来说是不可能的。(某事)
            - possible/impossible后接不定式时，且不定式中的do.成份完整，此时句子主语只能是形式主语it，而不能是普通实义名词。
            - 式主语it指代to + do.成份。
            - 所谓的do.成份完整是指:
            - 1. 如果do.是及物动词，则必须包含宾语。
            - 2. 如果do.是不及物动词，则必然已经完整。
        - It + be. + [possible/impossible] + that + 主语从句
            - possible/impossible后接that + 主语从句时，主句主语只能是形式主语it，而不能是普通实义名词。
            形- 式主语it指代主语从句成份。
