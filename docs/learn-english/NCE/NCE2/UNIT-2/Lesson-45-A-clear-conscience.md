# Lesson 45 A clear conscience 

## 中文

问心无愧

整个村子很快知道，有一大笔钱丢失了。

当地的屠户萨姆.本顿在把存款送往邮局的途中把钱包丢了。

萨姆确信那钱包一定是被某个村民捡到了，可是却不见有人来送还给他。

3个月过去了，后来在一天早晨，萨姆在自己的大门外发现了他的钱包。

钱包是用报纸包着的，里面有他丢失的钱的一半，而且还附着一张纸条，上面写着：“一个小偷，是的，但只是一个50%的小偷！”

又过了两个月，又有一些钱送还给了萨姆，又附了一张字条：“这回只是25%的小偷了！”

很快，萨姆全部的钱都用同样的方式还了回来。

最后的那张字条上写道：“我现在是一个100%的诚实人了！”
