# Lesson 41 Do you call that a hat

## 中文

“你把那个叫帽子吗？”我对妻子说。

“你说话没必要这样不客气，”我的妻子边回答边照着镜子。

我坐在一个新式的满是网眼儿的椅子上，等待着。

我们在这家帽店已经呆了半个小时了，而我的妻子仍在镜子面前。

“我们不应该买我们不需要的东西，”我突然发表意见说，但马上又后悔说了这话。

“你没必要这么说，”我妻子回答说，“我也不必提醒你昨天买的那条糟糕透了的领带。”

“我觉得它好看，”我说，“男人有多少领带也不会嫌多。”

“女人有多少帽子也不嫌多。”她回答。

10分钟以后，我们一道走出了商店。我妻子戴着一顶像灯塔一样的帽子。
