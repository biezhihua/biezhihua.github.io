## 中文

您要买什么，夫人？

一位穿着牛仔裤的妇女站在一家高档商店的橱窗前。

她虽然犹豫了片刻，但终于还是走进了商店，要求把陈列在橱窗里的一件衣服拿给她看。

接待她的售货员不喜欢她的那副打扮，轻蔑地看了她一眼后，便告诉她那件衣服已经卖出去了。

这位妇女怒气冲冲地走出了商店，决定第二天教训一下那个售货员。

第二天上午，她又来到这家商店，穿了一件裘皮大衣，一只手拎着一只手提包，另一只手拿着一把长柄伞。

找到那个无礼的售货员后，她还要看昨天的那件衣服。

那个售货员没有认出她是谁，这一回接待她的态度非常殷勤。

费了好大劲儿，他爬进橱窗去取那件衣服。

这位妇女对那件衣服只看一眼，就说不喜欢。

她开心地迫使那位售货员把橱窗里几乎所有的东西都拿了出来，最后才买下了她最先要看的那一件。
