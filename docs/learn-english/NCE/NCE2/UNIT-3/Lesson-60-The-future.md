卜算未来

在一个乡村集市上，我决定去拜访一位称作别林斯夫人的算命人。

我走进她的帐篷，她叫我坐下。

我给了她一些钱后，她便查看着一个水晶球说道：

“
您的一个亲戚就要来看您了。

她将于今天傍晚到达，并准备住上几天。

您一走出这个帐篷，就会大吃一惊。

一位您很熟悉的女人将向您冲来。

她会对您说点什么，然后带您离开这个地方。

就是这些。
”

我一走出帐篷，就把别林斯基夫人给算卦的事忘得一干二净了，因为我的妻子正匆匆向我跑来。

“你躲到哪儿去了？”她不耐烦地问，“再有不到一个小时你姐姐就要到这儿了，我们得去车站接她。现在就已经晚了。”

当她走开时，我也跟着她出了集市。

I went into her tent and she told me to sit down.

After I had given her some money, she looked **[lʊkt]** into a crystal ball **[bɔːl]** and said:

"
A relation of yours is coming to see you.
