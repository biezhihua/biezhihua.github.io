# Lesson 58 A blessing in disguise? 

## 中文

是因祸得福吗？

据说弗林利这个小村里有一颗“该诅咒的树”。

就因为报上提到过这棵树，所以现在来弗林利参观的人越来越多。

该树是50年前栽在教堂附近的，但只是近几年才得到了一个坏名声。

据说，谁要是触摸了这棵树，谁就会交上恶运；如果谁摘了一片树叶，谁就会死去。

很多村民相信此树已经害了不少人。

人们曾请求教区的牧师叫人把树砍掉，但他直到现在也没同意。

他指出，由于人们从全国各地纷纷前来参观这棵树，它成了一个有用的财源。

尽管上述种种说法，但游客们还是照常摘树叶和把他们的名字刻在树干上。

然而到目前为止，还没有一个人暴死呢！
