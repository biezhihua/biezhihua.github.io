# Lesson 75 SOS 

## 中文

呼救信号

不久前，一架轻型客机偏离了航线，在山区坠毁，飞行员丧生。

机上仅有的乘客，一位年轻的妇女和她的两个女婴却平安无事。

此时正值隆冬季节，地上积着厚厚的雪。

这位妇女知道，即使最近的村庄也有数英里远。

天黑下来的时候，她把提箱当作小床，把两个孩子放了进去，又把所有能找到的衣服都盖在了孩子们身上。

夜里，天冷得厉害。

这位妇女尽可能地靠近孩子，甚至自己也想钻进箱子里去，只是箱子太小了。

第二天一大早，她听到头顶上有飞机飞过，但不知道怎样才能发个信号。

后来她有了一个主意。

她在雪地上踩出了“SOS”这3个字母。

幸运得很，一位飞行员看到这个信号，用无线电给最近的城镇发了报。

不久，一架直升飞机飞抵飞机失事现场，来搭救这几个幸存者。
