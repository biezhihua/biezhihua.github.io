# Lesson 79 By air 

## 中文

乘飞机

我在幼年的时候，曾多次乘飞机旅行。

我的父母曾经住在南美洲，所以假期里我常从欧洲乘飞机到他们那里。

我总是由一位空中乘务员照管，从未遇到过不愉快的经历。

我习惯了乘飞机旅行，只是有一次把我吓坏了。

起飞之后，我们在城市上空低低地飞行，然后慢慢爬高。这时飞机突然调转头来，飞回了机场。

在我们等待降落时，一位空中乘务员告诉我们要保持镇静，待飞机一着陆，就马上不声不响地离开飞机。

飞机上的人都很着急，大家都急于想知道究竟出了什么事。

后来我们才得知，飞机上坐了一位非常重要的人物。

有人报告警察，说飞机上安放了一枚炸弹。

我们降落之后，飞机被彻底搜查了一遍。

幸运的是，什么也没有找到。5个小时后，我们又起飞了。
