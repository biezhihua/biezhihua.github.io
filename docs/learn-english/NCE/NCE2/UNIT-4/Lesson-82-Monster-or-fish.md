# Lesson 82 Monster or fish 

## 中文

是妖还是鱼?

渔夫和水手们有时声称自己看到过海里的妖怪。

虽然人们常常对水手们讲的故事付诸一笑，但现在看来，人们有时看到的这些“妖怪”很多不过是些奇怪的鱼。

一些异常的生物偶尔会被冲到岸上来，但它们在海上却极少能被捕到。

然而不久前，在马达加斯加附近的海里却捕到了一条奇怪的鱼。

一条小渔船被一条咬住钩的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。

那位渔民意识到这根本不是一条普通的鱼，于是千方百计不让它受到丝毫伤害。

当终于把它弄上岸后，人们发现它身长超过了13英尺。

它长着一个像马一样的头，有着大的蓝眼睛和闪闪发光的银色皮肤，还有一条鲜红色的尾巴。

此鱼叫桨鱼，被送进了博物馆，现正接受一位科学家的检查。

人们很少能看到活着的这类动物，因为它们生活在600英尺深的水下。
