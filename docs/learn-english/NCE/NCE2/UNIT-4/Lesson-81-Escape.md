## 中文

逃脱

那个战俘杀死卫兵以后，迅速地把尸体拖进了灌木丛。

他在黑暗中忙活了一阵儿，很快就换上了死者的衣服。

现在他身穿蓝军装，肩扛步枪，在军营门前大胆地来回走看。

他听得军营里面的喧闹声。

那里灯火通明，人们在东奔西跑：他们刚刚发现有一个俘虏跑了。

正在此时，一辆黑色大轿车在军营门口停了下来。里面坐了4个军官。

军官们下了车，战俘立正站好，并在他们从他面前经过时敬了礼。

他们走后，汽车司机向他走来，这人显然是想聊天。

他上了年纪，有着灰白的头发和明亮的蓝眼睛。

战俘为他感到惋惜，但却没有别的选择。

当这个人走近时，战俘一拳把他打倒在地。

然后跳进车里，以最快的速度把车开走了。
