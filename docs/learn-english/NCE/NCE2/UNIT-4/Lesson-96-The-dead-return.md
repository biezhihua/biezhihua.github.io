# Lesson 96 The dead return 

## 中文

亡灵返乡

日本每年过一次“亡灵节”。

这个节日是个欢乐的日子，因为在这一天，据说死去的人要回到他们的家里来，活着的人则对他们表示欢迎。

因为预料到他们在经过长途旅行之后会感到饥饿，所以为他们摆放好了食品。

特制的灯笼挂在各家的门外，为的是帮助亡灵看清道路。

整个夜晚人们载歌载舞。

一大早，人们便把为死者摆放的食品扔进河中或海里，因为人们认为活着的人吃了这些东西是不吉利的。

在靠海的城镇中，头天夜里挂在大街小巷的小灯笼在节后就放在了水里。

成千上万只灯笼慢慢漂向大海，指引着亡灵返回另一个世界。

这是一个感人的场面，人们成群地伫立在海岸上，注视着灯笼远去，直到再也看不见为止。
