## 中文

小象对警察

去年圣诞节，马戏团老板吉米.盖茨决定送些礼物给儿童医院。

他打扮成圣诞老人，在由6个漂亮姑娘组成的“仪仗队”的陪同下，骑上一头名叫江伯的小象，沿着城里的主要街道出发了。

他本该知道警察绝不会允许这类事情发生。

一个警察走过来告诉吉米，他应该走一条小路，因为江泊阻碍了交通。

虽然吉米同意马上就走，但江伯却拒绝移动。

15个警察不得不用很大的力气把它推离主要街道。

警察虽然吃了苦头，但他们还是感到很有趣。

“江伯一定有好几吨重，”一个警察事后这样说，“值得庆幸的是它没让我们抬它走。当然，我们应该逮捕它，但由于它一贯表现很好，这次我们饶了它。”

## 英文

Last Christmas **[ˈkrɪsməs]**, the circus owner, Jimmy **[ˈdʒɪmi]** Gates, decided to take some presents to a children's hospital.

Dressed **[drest]** up as Father Christmas and accompanied **[əˈkʌmp(ə)nid]** by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant **[ˈelɪfənt]** called Jumbo **[ˈdʒʌmbəʊ]**.

He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.

A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holing up the traffic.

Though Jimmy agreed **[əˈɡriːd]** to go at once, Jumbo refused to move.

Fifteen policeman had to push very hard to get him off the main street.

The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused.

'Jumbo must weigh a few tons **[tʌnz]**' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate **[ˈfɔːtʃənət]** that we didn't have to carry him. Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall **[ʃæl]** let him off this time."
