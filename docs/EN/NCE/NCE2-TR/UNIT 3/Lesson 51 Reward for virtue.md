# Lesson 51 Reward for virtue 

## 中文

对美德的奖赏

我的朋友休一直很胖，但是近来情况变得越发糟糕，以致他决定节食。

他是一星期前开始节食的。

首先，他开列了一张长长的单子，上面列了所有禁吃的食物。

这张单子上的大多数食物都是休喜欢吃的：黄油、土豆、米饭、啤酒、牛奶、巧克力和糖果。

昨天我去看望了他。

我按响了门铃，当看到休仍和往常一样胖时，我并不感到惊奇。

他把我领进屋，慌忙把一个大包藏到了桌子下面。

显然他感到很尴尬。

当我问他正干什么时，他内疚地笑了，然后把那个大包拿到了桌上。

他解释说，他的饮食控制得太严格了，以致不得不偶尔奖赏自己一下。

接着他给我看了包里的东西。

里面装了5大块巧克力和3袋糖果！


## 英文

My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but things got so bad recently that he decided **[dɪˈsaɪdɪd]** to go on a diet.

He began his diet a week ago.

First of all, he wrote **[rəʊt]** out a long list of all the food which were forbidden.

The list included most of the things Hugh loves: butter, potatoes, rice **[raɪs]**, beer, milk, chocolate, and sweets.

Yesterday I paid him a visit.

I rang **[ræŋ]** the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever.

He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.

It was obvious **[ˈɒbviəs]** that he was very embarrassed **[ɪmˈbærəst**].

When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.

He explained **[ɪkˈspleɪnd]** that his diet was so strict **[strɪkt]** that he had to reward himself occasionally **[əˈkeɪʒnəli]**.

Then he showed me the contents of the parcel.

It contained five large bars of chocolate **[ˈtʃɒklət]** and three bags of sweets!.
