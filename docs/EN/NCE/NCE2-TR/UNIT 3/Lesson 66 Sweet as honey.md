# Lesson 66 Sweet as honey! 

## 中文

像蜜一样甜

1963年，一架兰开斯特轰炸机在瓦立斯岛追毁。那是南太洋中一个很偏僻的小岛，位于萨摩亚群岛以西，距离群岛还有很长一段距离。

飞机损坏的程度并不严重，但是，多年来这起飞机失事已被遗忘，飞机残骸也没受到破坏。

于是，到了1989年，飞机失事26年后，在对小岛的一次航空勘查中那架飞机被意外地发现了。

到了那个时候，状况良好的兰开斯特轰炸机实属罕见，值得抢救。

法国政府让人把飞机包装起来，一部分一部分地搬回法国。

一群热心人计划修复这架飞机。

该飞机装装配有4台罗尔斯-罗伊斯的默林发动机，但是他们只需要修复其中的3台。

想一想他们所感受到的惊奇和兴奋，当他们拆开包装箱时，他们发现第4台发动机就像蜂蜜一样甜 - 发动机完好无损。

一群蜜蜂把发动机当作了蜂房，发动机在蜂蜡中被完整地保存了下来。

## 英文

In 1963 a Lancaster **[ˈlæŋkəstə(r)]** bomber **[ˈbɒmə(r)]** crashed on Wallis Island **[ˈaɪlənd]**, a remote **[rɪˈməʊt]** place **[pleɪs]** in the South Pacific[pəˈsɪfɪk], a long way west[west] of Samoa.

The plane wasn't too badly damaged, but over the years, the crash was forgotten **[fəˈɡɒtn]** and the wreck **[rek]** remained **[rɪˈmeɪnd]** undisturbed **[ˌʌndɪˈstɜːbd]**.

Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial **[ˈeəriəl]** survey **[ˈsɜːveɪ]** of the island.

By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing **[ˈreskjuːɪŋ]**.

The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France.

Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored **[rɪˈstɔːd]**.

It has four Rolls **[rəʊlz]**-Royce **[rɔɪs]** Merlin **[ˈmɜːlɪn]** engines **[ˈɛndʒəns]**, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt.

Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey **[ˈhʌni]** -- still in perfect condition.

A colony **[ˈkɒləni]** of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved **[prɪˈzɜːvd]** in beeswax!
