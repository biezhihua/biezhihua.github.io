# Lesson 61 Trouble with the Hubble 

## 中文

哈勃望远镜的困境

哈勃望远镜于1990年4月20日由国家航空航天局发射升空，耗资10多亿美元。

从最开始哈勃望远镜就有问题。

它传送给我们的图像很令人失望，因为它的主要镜子有误差。

国家航天局准备纠正这一错误，为此将把4名宇航员送入太空修复望远镜。

“奋进”号航天飞机将把宇航员送上哈勃。

当宇航员进行必要的修复工作时，“奋进”号上的一只机器手将抓住望远镜并托住它。

当然，哈勃位于地球的大气层之外，因此，它很快就会给我们传送我们所见到过的、有关行星和远距离星系的最清晰的照片。

哈勃将告诉我们有关宇宙的年龄和大小的许多事情。

等到你读到这篇文章时，敏锐的哈勃望远镜已经为我们送来了成千上万张精彩的照片。

Endeavour

## 英文

The Hubble **[ˈhʌb(ə)l]** telescope **[ˈtelɪskəʊp]** was launched **[lɔːntʃt]** into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at a cost **[kɒst]** of over a billion dollars.

Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble.

The pictures it sent us were very disappointing **[ˌdɪsəˈpɔɪntɪŋ]** because its main **[meɪn]** mirror was faulty.

NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending four astronauts **[ˈæstrəˌnɔt]** to repair it.

The shuttle **[ˈʃʌt(ə)l]** Endeavour **[ɪnˈdevə(r)]** will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble.

A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs.

Of course, the Hubble is above **[əˈbʌv]** the earth's atmosphere **[ˈætməsfɪə(r)]**, so it will soon be sending us the clearest **[klɪrɪst]** pictures of the stars and distant galaxies **[ˈɡæləksiz]** that we have ever seen.

The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.

By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle **[ˈiːɡ(ə)l]** eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.
