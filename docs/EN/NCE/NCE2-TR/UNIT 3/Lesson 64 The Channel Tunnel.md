# Lesson 64 The Channel Tunnel 

## 中文

海峡隧道

1858年，一位名叫埃梅.托梅.德.干蒙的法国工程师带着建造一条长21英里、穿越英吉利海陕的隧道计划到了英国。

他说，可以在隧道中央建造一座平台，这座平台将用作码头和火车站。

如果再建些伸出海面的高大的烟囱状通风管，隧道就具备了良好的通风条件。

1860年，一位名叫威廉.洛的英国人提出了一项更好的计划。

他提议建一条双轨隧道。

这样就解决了通风问题。因为如果有列火车开进隧道，它就把新鲜空气随之抽进了隧道。

42年以后，隧道实际已经开始建了。

如果不是因为那时英国人害怕入侵，隧道早已建成了。

世界不得不再等将近100年才看到海峡隧道竣工。

它于1994年3月7日正式开通，将英国与欧洲大陆连到了一起。

## 英文

In 1858, a French engineer **[ˌendʒɪˈnɪə(r)]**, Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel **[ˈtʌn(ə)l]** under the English Channel.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre **[ˈsentə(r)]** of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.

The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys **[ˈtʃɪmniz]** were built above sea level.

In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low.

He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built. 

This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train centered **[ˈsentəd]** this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.

Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun.

If, at the time, the British **[ˈbrɪtɪʃ]** had not feared **[fɪəd]** invasion **[ɪnˈveɪʒ(ə)n]**, it would have been completed.

The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.

I was officially **[əˈfɪʃəli]** opened on March 7 1994, finally connecting Britain **[ˈbrɪt(ə)n]** to the European continent **[ˈkɒntɪnənt]**.
