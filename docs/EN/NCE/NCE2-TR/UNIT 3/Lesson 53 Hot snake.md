# Lesson 53 Hot snake 

## 中文

触电的蛇

消防队员们终于扑灭了加利福尼亚的一场森林大火。

从那时起，他们一直试图找出起火的原因。

森林火灾时常由破碎的玻璃或人们随手扔掉的香烟头引起。

昨天，消防队员仔细查看了地面，但未能发现碎玻璃。

他们还十分肯定火灾也不是由烟头引起的。

然而今天上午，一个消防队员偶然发现了起火的原因。

他发现了缠绕在16,000伏高压线上的一条死蛇。

就这样，他解开了起火之谜。

解释很简单，却异乎寻常。

一只鸟把蛇从地上抓起来，然后把它扔到了电线上。

于是蛇就缠住了几根电线。

当它这样做时，把火花送到了地面，这些火花立刻引起了一场大火。
