# Lesson 63 She was not amused 

## 中文

她并不觉得好笑

杰里米.汉普登交际甚广，是各种聚会上深受大家欢迎的人。

人人都钦佩他那绝妙的幽默感 -- 人人，就是说，除他6岁的女儿珍妮之外的每一个人。

最近，杰里米的一个最亲密的朋友请他在一个婚礼上祝词。

这正是杰里米喜欢做的事情。

他认真准备了讲稿，带着珍妮一道去参加了婚礼。

他的祝词里面加进了大量逗人的故事，自然大获成功。

他刚一讲完，珍妮就对他说她要回家。

这不免使杰里米有点扫兴，但他还是按照女儿的要求做了。

在回家的路上，他问珍妮是否喜欢他的祝词。

使他吃惊的是，她说她不喜欢。

杰里米问他为何不喜欢，她说她不愿意看到那么多的人嘲笑他！

Everybody admires **[ədˈmaɪə(r)]** him for his great sense of humour - everybody, that is, except his six-year-old daughter **[ˈdɔːtə(r)]**, Jenny **[ˈdʒeni]**.

Recently, one of Jeremy's closest friends asked him to make a speech at a wedding reception **[rɪˈsepʃ(ə)n]**.

This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves.

He prepared **[prɪˈpeəd]** the speech carefully and went to the weeding with Jenny.

He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success.

As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home.

Jeremy was a little disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked.

On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech.
