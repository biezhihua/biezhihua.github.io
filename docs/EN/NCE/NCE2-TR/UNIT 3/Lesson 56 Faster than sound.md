旧式汽车的比赛每年举行一次。

去年有很多汽车参加了这项比赛。比赛开始之前，人们异常激动。

最漂亮的汽车之一是罗尔斯--罗伊斯生产的银鬼汽车，而最不寻常的一辆则要属只有3只轮子的奔驰牌汽车了。

该车造于1885年，是参赛车中最老的一辆。

在好一阵喧闹的爆炸声之后，比赛开始了。

很多汽车在途中就抛了锚，而有些驾驶员花在汽车底下的时间比坐在汽车里面的时间还长。

然而还是有几辆汽车跑完了全程。

获胜的那辆车达到了时速40英里--远远超过任何对手。

它在接近终点时，冲下了山坡，驾驶员费了好大劲才把车停下来。

这次比赛使每个人都挺开心。

它虽然与现代汽车比赛大不相同，但激动人心的程度并不亚于现代化汽车大赛。
