# Lesson 70 Red for danger 

## 中文

危险的红色

在一次斗牛时，一个醉汉突然溜达到斗牛场中间。

人们开始大叫起来，但醉汉却没有意识到危险。

当时那公牛正忙于对付斗牛士，但突然它看见了醉汉，只见他正大声说着粗鲁的话，手里挥动着一顶红帽子。

对挑衅显然非常敏感的公牛完全撇开斗牛士，直奔醉汉而来。

观众突然静了下来，可这醉汉像是很有把握似的。

当公牛逼近他时，他踉跄地住旁边一闪，牛扑空了。

观众欢呼起来，醉汉向人们鞠躬致谢。

然而，此时已有3个人进入斗牛场，迅速把醉汉拉到安全的地方。

好像连牛也在为他感到遗憾，因为它一直同情地看着醉汉，直到他的背影消逝，才重新将注意力转向斗牛士。
