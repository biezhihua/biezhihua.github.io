# Lesson 50 Taken for a ride  

## 中文

乘车兜风

我喜欢在乡间旅行，但却不愿意迷路。

最近我作了一次短途旅行，但这次旅行所花费的时间比我预计的要长。

“我要去伍德福德草地，”我一上车就对售票员说，“但我不知道它在那儿。”

“我来告诉您在哪儿下车，”售票员回答说。

我坐在汽车的前部，以便饱览农村风光。

过了一些时候，车停了。

我环视了一下身旁，惊奇地发现车里就只剩我一个乘客了。

“您得在这里下车，”售票员说，“我们的车就到此为止了。”

“这里是伍德福德草地吗？”我问道。

“哎呀，”售票员突然说，“我忘了让您下车了。”

“没关系，”我说，“我就在这儿下吧。”

“我们现在要返回去，”售票员说。

“好吧，既然如此，我还是留在车上吧。”我回答说。

## 英文

I love travelling in the country, but I don't like losing my way.

I went on an excursion **[ɪkˈskɜːʃn]** recently, but my trip took me longer than I excepted **[ɪkˈspektɪd]**.

"I'm going to Woodford Green" I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, "but I don't know where it is"

"I'll tell you where to get off" answered the conductor.

I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.

After some time, the bus stopped.

Looking around, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.

"You'll have to get off here" the conductor said "This is as far as we go".

"Is this Woodford Green?" I asked.

"Oh dear" said the conductor suddenly. "I forget to put you off".

"It doesn't matter" I said "I'll get off here".

'We're going back now" said the conductor.

"Well, in that case, I prefer **[prɪˈfɜː(r)]** to stay on the bus" I answered.
