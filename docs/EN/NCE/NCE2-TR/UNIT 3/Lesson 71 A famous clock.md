# Lesson 71 A famous clock 

## 中文

一个著名的大钟

当你游览伦敦时，首先看到的东西之一就是“大本”钟，即那座从英国广播公司的广播中全世界都可以听到它的声音的著名大钟。

如果不是国会大厦在1834年被焚毁的话，这座大钟永远也不会建造。

“大本”钟得名于本杰明.霍尔爵士，因为当建造新的国会大厦时，他负责建造大钟。

此钟不仅外型巨大，而且走时也非常准确。

格林尼治天文台的官员们每天两次派人矫正此钟。

当大钟打点的时候，你可以从英国广播公司的广播中听到，因为钟塔上接了麦克风。

“大本”钟很多出差错。然而有一次，它却把时间报错。

在钟塔上干活的一位油漆工把一只油漆桶挂在了一根指针上，把钟弄慢了！

## 英文

When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard **[hɜːd]** all over the world on the B.B.C.

If the Houses **[ˈhaʊzɪz]** of Parliament had not been burned **[bɜːnd]** down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected **[ɪˈrektɪd]**.

Big Ben takes **[teɪks]** it name from Sir Benjamin **[ˈbendʒəmɪn]** Hall **[hɔːl]** who was responsible **[rɪˈspɒnsəb(ə)l]** for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built.

It is not only of immense **[ɪˈmens]** size, but is extremely **[ɪkˈstriːmli]** accurate **[ˈækjərət]** as well.

Officials from Greenwich **[ˈɡrenɪtʃ; ˈɡrenɪdʒ]** Observatory have the clock checked **[tʃekt]** twice a day.

On the B.B.C you can hear the clock when it is actually **[ˈæktʃuəli]** striking **[ˈstraɪkɪŋ]** because microphones are connected to the clock tower **[ˈtaʊə(r)]**.

Bing Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed **[feɪld]** to give the correct **[kəˈrekt]** time.

A painter **[ˈpeɪntə(r)]** who had been working on the tower hung **[hʌŋ]** a pot of paint on one of the hands **[hændz]** and slowed it down!
