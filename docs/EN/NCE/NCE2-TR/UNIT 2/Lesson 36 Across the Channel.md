## 分析

Debbie Hart is going to swim across the English Channel tomorrow.
- simple sentence:
    - Debbie Hart [subject]
    - is going to do [predicate verb]
    - to swim across the English Channel tomorrow [object]
        - swim [verb]
        - across the English Channel [object]
        - tomorrow [time adverbial]
- knowledge:
    - be. + going + to + do. + (sth.)
        - v. (主观)[将要/打算/计划]...(做某事); (客观)[将/要]...(发生某事)
    -  翻译成中文是 明天 计划 横渡 英吉利海峡。
        - 这里的tomorrow 和 is going to 表计划 都可以看做对 swim across 的修饰。 
        - 我自己的习惯更愿意把 is going to swim across 看做一个整体。 
        - 如果要拆分清晰，is going to 和 to swim across 其实swim across 才是重心动作。 
        - 按照这样理解，其实tomorrow看做swim across的状语更合适一些。
