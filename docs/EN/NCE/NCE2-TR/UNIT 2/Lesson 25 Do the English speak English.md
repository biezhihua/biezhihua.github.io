# Lesson 25 Do the English speak English?

## 中文

我终于到了伦敦。

火车站很大，又黑又暗。

我不知道去饭店的路该怎么走，于是向一个搬运工打听。

我的英语讲得不但非常认真，而且咬字也非常清楚。

然而搬运工却不明白我的话。

我把问话重复了很多遍。他终于听懂了。

他回答了，但他讲得既不慢也不清楚。

“我是个外国人，”我说。

于是他说得慢了，可我还是听不懂。我的老师从来不那样讲英语！

我和搬运工相视一笑。

接着，他说了点什么，这回我听懂了。

“您会很快学会英语的！”他说。

我感到奇怪。在英国，人们各自说着一种不同的语言。

英国人之间相互听得懂，可我却不懂他们的话！

他们说的是英语吗？

## 英文

I arrived in London at last/lɑːst/.

The railway station was big, black and dark.

I did not know the way to my hotel/həʊˈtel/ , so I asked a porter/ˈpɔːtə(r)/.

I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well.

The porter, however, could not understand me. 

I repeated my question several times and at last he understood/ˌʌndəˈstʊd/.

He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.

"I am a foreigner" I said.

Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that!

The porter and I looked/lʊkt/ at each other and smiled.

Then he said something and I understood it.

"You'll soon learn English" he said.

I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language.

The English understand each other, but I don't understand them!.

Do they speak English?


## 分析

I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter, I not only spoke/spəʊk/ English carefully, but very clearly as well.

    - the way to my hotel 宾语
    - 你说的是对的，如果是定语修饰名词，把定语去掉，那么句子应该也是通顺的。
    - 但是如果直接把to my hotel 去掉， 句子就不通顺了。  
    - I did not know the way。 我不知道路。就看起来很奇怪。所以这个 to my hotel 是个必要的成分。 
    - 那么唯一能解释的就是 the way to my hotel 是整个宾语， thy way to 就是个固定搭配了。
      - the way to + sth 固定搭配，同向....的路
    - 如何分析
      - I love the box on the table,     the box is on the table
      - I love the way to school,         the way is to school就不行了
      - 我感觉你这个方式的本质是判定后面的on the table 和 to school 与前面名词的关系。 是修饰关系，还是整体关系。
