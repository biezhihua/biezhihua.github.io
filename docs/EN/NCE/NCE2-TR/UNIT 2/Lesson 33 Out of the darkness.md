# Lesson 33 Out of the darkness

## 中文

几乎过了一个星期，那姑娘才能讲述自己的遭遇。

一天下午，她乘小船从海岸出发，遇上了风暴。

天将黑时，小船撞在了一块礁石上，姑娘跳进了海里。

她在海里游了整整一夜才游到岸边。

在那段时间里，她游了8英里。

第二天凌晨，她看到前方有灯光，知道自己已经接近岸边了，因为那灯光是在高高的峭壁上。

到达岸边后，姑娘朝着她看到的灯光方向挣扎着往峭壁上爬去。

她所记得的就是这些。

第二天她醒来时，发现自己躺在医院里。


## 英文

Nearly a week passed/pɑːst/ before the girl was able to explain what had happened to her.

One afternoon she set out from the coast/kəʊst/ in a small boat and was caught in a storm.

Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl jumped into the sea.

Then she swam/swæm/ to the shore after spending the whole night in the water.

During that time she covered a distance of eight miles.

Early next morning, she saw a light ahead. She knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs.

On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled/ˈstrʌɡ(ə)ld/ up the cliff/klɪf/ towards the light she had seen.

That was all she remembered.

When she woke up a day later, she found herself in hospital.
