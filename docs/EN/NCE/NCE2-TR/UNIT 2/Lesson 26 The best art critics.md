# Lesson 26 The best art critics

## 中文

我是个学艺术的学生，画了很多画。

有很多人装成很懂现代艺术的样子。

总是告诉你一幅画的“意思”是什么。

当然，有很多画是什么“意思”也没有的。

它们就是些好看的图案，我们喜爱它们就像我们喜欢漂亮的窗帘布一样。

我觉得小孩子们往往比任何人都更能欣赏现代绘画，他们观察到的东西更多。

我的妹妹只有7岁，但她总能说出我的画是好还是坏。

昨天她到我房里来了。

"你在干什么呢" 她问。

"我正在把这幅画挂到墙上去。" 我回答说。 "这是幅新画，你喜欢吗?"

她用挑剔的目光看了一会。 

"还可以吧"她说，"不过，是不是挂倒了？"

我再次看了看画。 她说对了! 是挂到了!

## 英文

I am an art student and I paint/peɪnt/ a lot of pictures.

Many people pretend that they understand modern art. 

They always tell you what a picture is "about".

Of course, many pictures are not "about" anything.

They are just pretty/ˈprɪti/ patterns/ˈpætənz/. We like them in the same way that we like pretty curtain material/məˈtɪəriəl/.

I think that young children often appreciate modern pictures better than anyone else. They notice more.

My sister is only seven, but she always tells me whether/ˈweðə(r)/ my pictures are good or not.

She came into my room yesterday.

"What are you doing" she asked.

"I'm hanging this picture on the wall/wɔːl/" I answered. "It's a new one. Do you like it"

She looked at it critically for a moment.

"It's all right" she said, "but isn't it upside down?"

I looked at it again. She was right! It was!
