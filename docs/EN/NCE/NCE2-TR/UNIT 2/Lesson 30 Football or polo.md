# Lesson 30 Football or polo

## 中文

威尔河是横穿过我家附近公园的一条小河。

我喜欢在天气晴朗的下午到河边坐坐。

上星期日天气很暖和。于是我和往常一样，又去河边坐着。

河岸上有些孩子正在玩耍，河面上有些人正在划船。

突然，一个孩子狠狠地踢了一脚球，球便向着一只划过来的小船飞去。

岸上的一些人对着小船上的人高喊，但他没有听见。

球重重地打在他身上，使他差点儿落入水中。

我转过头去看那些孩子，但一个也不见，全都跑了！

当那个人明白了发生的事情时，笑了起来。

他大声叫着那些孩子，把球扔回到岸上。

Wayle


## 英文

The Wayle is a small/smɔːl/ river that cuts across the park near my home.

I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons/ˌɑːftəˈnuːnz/.

It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual.

Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.

Suddenly, one of children kicked/kɪkt/ a ball/bɔːl/ very hard and it went towards a passing boat.

Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them.

The ball struck/strʌk/ him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight: they had all run away!.

The man laughed/lɑːft/ when he realized what had happened.

He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.
