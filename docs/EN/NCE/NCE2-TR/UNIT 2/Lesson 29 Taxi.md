# Lesson 29 Taxi

## 中文

本.弗西特机长买了一辆不同寻常的出租汽车，并开始了一项新的业务。

这辆“出租汽车”是一架小型瑞士飞机，叫“皮勒特斯.波特“号。

这架奇妙的飞机可以载7名乘客。

然而，最令人惊奇的是它能够在任何地方降落：雪地上，水面上，甚至刚耕过的田里。

弗西特机长的第一名乘客是位医生，他从伯明翰飞往威尔士山区一个偏僻的村庄。

从那时开始，弗西特机长已经载送乘客到过许多不寻常的地方。

一次，他把飞机降落在了一栋公寓楼的屋顶上；还有一次，降落在了一个废弃的停车场上。

弗西特机长刚刚拒绝了一位商人的奇怪要求。

这个人想要飞往大西洋上的一个孤岛 -- 罗卡尔岛，弗西特机长之所以不送他去，是因为那段飞行太危险了。

## 英文

Captain Ben Fawcett/ˈfɔsɪt/ has bought an unusual taxi and has begun/bɪˈɡʌn/ a new service.

The 'taxi' is a small Swiss/swɪs/ airplane called a 'Pilatus Porter'.

This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers.

The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere/ˈeniweə(r)/: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed filed.

Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains.

Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places/ˈpleɪsɪz/.

Once he landed/ˈlændɪd/ on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. 

Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman.

The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous/ˈdeɪndʒərəs/.

- a block of flats 一栋公寓
