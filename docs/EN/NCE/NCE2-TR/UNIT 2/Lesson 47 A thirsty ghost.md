# Lesson 47 A thirsty ghost 

## 中文

嗜酒的鬼魂

伊恩.汤普森先生最近才买的一个小酒店现在又要卖出去。

汤普森先生之所以想卖它，是因为那里常闹鬼。

他告诉我有天夜里他怎么也睡不着，因为他听到酒吧里传来一阵奇怪的响声。

第二天早上，他发现酒吧间的门被椅子堵上了，家具也被挪动过。

虽然汤普森临睡觉时把灯关了，但早晨灯却都亮着。

他还说他发现了5只空的威士忌瓶子，肯定是鬼魂昨天晚上喝的。

当我暗示说一定是村里有些人来喝不花钱的酒时，汤普森先生摇了摇头。

村里的人已经告诉他，即使他把小酒店白送人，他们也不要。

## 英文

A public house which was recently bought by Mr.Thompson/'tɔmpsn/ is up for sale.

Mr.Thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted[ˈhɔːntɪd].

He told me he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise coming from the bar.

The next[nekst] morning, he found that the doors had been blocked by chair and the furniture had been moved.

Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning.

He also said that he had found five empty whisky which the ghost must have drunk the night before.

When I suggested that some villagers[ˈvɪlɪdʒər] must have come in for a free drink, Mr.Thompson shook his head.

The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.
