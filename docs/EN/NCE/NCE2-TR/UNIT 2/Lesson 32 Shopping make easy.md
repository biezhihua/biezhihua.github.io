# Lesson 32 Shopping made easy

## 中文

人们不再像以前那样诚实了。

偷窃的诱惑力比以往任何时候都更强烈 -- 特别是在大的商店里。

一名侦探最近注意上了一位穿着讲究的妇女，她总是在星期一上午进入一家大商场。

有一个星期一，当这位妇女走进这家商场时，里面的人比往常少，因此，侦探比较容易监视她。

这位妇女先是买了几样小商品。

过了一会儿，她又选了商场里最昂贵的一件衣服，把它递给了售货员。那售货员以最快的速度为她包好了衣服。

然后，那妇女拿过包就走出了商场，根本没有付钱。

她被逮捕后。侦探发现原来那售货员是她的女儿。

那姑娘每星期“送”她母亲一件免费的衣服！

## 英文

People are not so honest as they once were.

The temptation to steal is greater/greɪtə(r)/ than ever before - especially in large shops.

A detective recently watched a well-dress woman who always went into a large store/stɔː(r)/ on Monday mornings.

One Monday, there were fewer/ˈfjuːə(r)/ people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier/ˈiːzɪə/ for the detective to watch her.

Two woman first bought a few small articles.

After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive/ɪkˈspensɪv/ dresses/dresɪz/ in the shop and handed/ˈhændɪd/ it to an assistant who wrapped/ræpt/ it up for her as quickly as possible. 

Then the woman simple took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying.

When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter/ˈdɔːtə(r)/.

The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once a week!.
