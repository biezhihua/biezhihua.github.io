# Lesson 40 Food and talk 

## 中文

进餐与交谈

在上星期的一次宴会上，女主人安排我坐在兰伯尔德夫人的身旁。

兰伯尔德夫人是一位身材高大、表情严肃的女人，穿一件紧身的黑衣服。

当我在她身旁坐下来的时候，她甚至连头都没有抬一下。

她的眼睛盯着自己的盘子，不一会儿就忙着吃起来了。

我试图找个话题和她聊聊。

"一出新剧要来"环球剧场"上演了" 我说 "您去看么"

"不" 她回答

"您今年去国外度假吗?" 我又问

“不” 她回答

“您就呆在英国吗？” 我问

“不” 她回答

失望之中我问她饭是否吃的满意。

“年轻人” 她回答说，“如果你多吃点，少说点，我们两个都会吃得好”
