水晶宫

19世纪最不寻常的建筑也许要数水晶宫了，它是为1851年的“世界博览会”而建在海德公园的。

这座水晶宫不同于世界上所有的其他建筑，因为它是用钢和玻璃建成的。

它是有史以来最高大的建筑物之一，因此，人们从各个国家纷纷前来参观。

大量的商品从世界各地运送到了博览会，参展的还有很多机器，其中最奇妙的是内史密斯的蒸汽锤。

尽管在当时旅行不像现在这么容易，但汽船还是把成千上万的参观者从欧洲大陆送过了英吉利海峡。

一到英国，火车就把他们送到了水晶宫。

参观的人数总共是600万，博览会的赢利用来建造博物馆和高等学校。

后来，“水晶宫”被移到了伦敦南部。

在1936年被焚毁之前，它一直是世界上最著名的建筑物之一。
