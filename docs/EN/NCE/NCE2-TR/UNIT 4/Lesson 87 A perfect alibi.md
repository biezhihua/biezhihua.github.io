# Lesson 87 A perfect alibi

## 中文

极好的不在犯罪现场的证据

“在凶杀发生的时候，我正坐在8点钟开往伦敦的火车上。”那人说。

“您总是赶这样早的火车？”探长问。

“当然是的，”那人回答。“我必须在10点钟上班，我的雇主会证明我是按时到了那儿的。”

“晚一点儿的车也能送您按时上班吗？”

“我认为可以，但我从来不乘晚一点儿的车。”

“您几点钟到的火车站？”

“7点50分。我买了张报纸，等着车来。”

“您没有注意到有什么异常情况发生吗？”

“当然没有。”

“我提醒您，”探长说，“您讲的不是实话。您乘的不是8点钟的火车，而是8点25分的，这次车同样能使您按时上班。您看，在凶杀发生的那天早晨，8点钟的那次车根本没有发。它在芬格林车站出了故障而被取消了。”

## 英文

'At the time the murder **[ˈmɜːdə(r)]** was committed **[kəˈmɪtɪd]**, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London' said the man.

'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector **[ɪnˈspektə(r)]**.

'Of course I do' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer **[ɪmˈplɔɪə(r)]** will confirm that I was there on time'.

'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.

'I suppose **[səˈpəʊz]** it would, but I never catch a later train.'

'At what time did you arrive at the station?'

'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'

'And you didn't notice **[ˈnəʊtɪs]** anything unusual?'

'Of course not'.

'I suggest' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train, but that you caught **[kɔːt]** the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time. You see, on the morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line'
