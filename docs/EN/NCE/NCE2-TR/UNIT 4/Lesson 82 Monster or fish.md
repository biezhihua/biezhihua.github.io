# Lesson 82 Monster or fish 

## 中文

是妖还是鱼?

渔夫和水手们有时声称自己看到过海里的妖怪。

虽然人们常常对水手们讲的故事付诸一笑，但现在看来，人们有时看到的这些“妖怪”很多不过是些奇怪的鱼。

一些异常的生物偶尔会被冲到岸上来，但它们在海上却极少能被捕到。

然而不久前，在马达加斯加附近的海里却捕到了一条奇怪的鱼。

一条小渔船被一条咬住钩的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。

那位渔民意识到这根本不是一条普通的鱼，于是千方百计不让它受到丝毫伤害。

当终于把它弄上岸后，人们发现它身长超过了13英尺。

它长着一个像马一样的头，有着大的蓝眼睛和闪闪发光的银色皮肤，还有一条鲜红色的尾巴。

此鱼叫桨鱼，被送进了博物馆，现正接受一位科学家的检查。

人们很少能看到活着的这类动物，因为它们生活在600英尺深的水下。

## 英文

Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim **[kleɪm]** to have seen monsters **[ˈmɒnstəz]** in the sea.

Though people have often laughed **[lɑːft]** at stories told by sea-men, it is now know that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted **[ˈsaɪtɪd]** are simply strange fish.

Occasionally, unusual creatures **[ˈkriːtʃəz]** are washed **[wɒʃt]** to the shore, but they are rarely caught **[kɔːt]** out at sea.

Some time ago, however, a peculiar **[pɪˈkjuːliə(r)]** fish was caught near Madagascar **[ˌmædəˈɡæskə(r)]**.

A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled **[ˈpʊld]** on the line.

Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort **[ˈefət]** not to damage it in any way.

When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.

It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining **[ˈʃaɪnɪŋ]** sliver **[ˈslɪvə(r)]** skin **[skɪn]**, and a bright red tail **[teɪl]**.

The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is begin examined by a scientist **[ˈsaɪəntɪst]**, it called an oarfish **[ˈɔːfɪʃ]**.

Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth **[depθ]** of six hundred feet.
