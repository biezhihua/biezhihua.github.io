# Lesson 94 Future champions 

## 中文

未来的冠军

实验证明，儿童在很小的时候就可以开始学习游泳。

在洛杉矶的一个特设的游泳池里，孩子们甚至在还没有学会走路时就已经能熟练地在水下屏住呼吸了。

两个月的婴儿并未显得不愿意入水。

他们很快便适应了游泳，以致能捡起池底的物品。

这些幼小的游泳运动员非常喜爱的一种游戏是水下三轮车比赛。

三轮车并排放在7英尺深的游泳池底上。

孩子们比赛看谁先到达游泳池的另一端。

很多孩子用脚蹬车，但多数孩子更愿意推或是拉着三轮车。

有些孩子能够跑完游泳池的全长而不用露出水面换气。

他们将来是否能成为奥林匹克的冠军，这只能由时间来作出回答。

与此同时，他们对我们中的那些游不了5码就已喘不过气来的人应该是种鼓舞。
