# Lesson 86 Out of control 

## 中文

失控

当那人试图让快艇转弯时，方向盘脱手了。

他绝望地向他的伙伴挥手，他的伙伴在过去的15分钟里一直在滑水。

他们两个还没来得及意识到究竟发生了什么事情，就被猛地抛入了海里。

快艇撞上了一个浮标，但它仍在水面上快速行驶着。

两个人刚开始向岸边游去，就突然惊愕地发现快艇正在转着圈行驶，它现在正以惊人的速度直冲他们驶来。

不到1分钟的工夫，它从离他们只有几英尺远的地方呼啸着驶了过去。

快艇过去之后，他们以最快的速度向前游去，因为他们知道快艇马上就要转回来。

他们刚刚来得及游出危险区，快艇就又转完了一圈。

然而这一次它的速度慢多了。

汽油几乎已经用光。

没过多久，噪音便彻底消失，快艇开始在水面上慢悠悠地漂流。

As the man tried to swing the speedboat round, the steering **[ˈstɪərɪŋ]** wheel **[wiːl]** came away in his hands.

He waved **[weɪvd]** desperately **[ˈdespərətli]** to his companion **[kəmˈpænjən]**, who had been water skiing **[ˈskiːɪŋ]** for the last fifteen minutes.

Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently **[ˈvaɪələntli]** into the sea.

The speedboat had struck a buoy **[bɔɪ]**, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.

Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in circle. It now came straight **[streɪt]** towards them at tremendous **[trəˈmendəs]** speed.

In less than a minute, it roared **[rɔːd]** past them only a few feet away.

After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return.

They had just had enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle **[ˈsɜːk(ə)l]**.

On this occasion, however, it has slowed **[sləʊd]** down considerably **[kənˈsɪdərəbli]**.

The petrol had nearly all been used **[juːst]** up.

Before long, the noise dropped **[drɒpt]** completed and the boat began **[bɪˈɡæn]** to drift **[drɪft]** gently **[ˈdʒentli]** across the water.
