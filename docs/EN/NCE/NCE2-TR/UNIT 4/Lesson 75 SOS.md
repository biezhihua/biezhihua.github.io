# Lesson 75 SOS 

## 中文

呼救信号

不久前，一架轻型客机偏离了航线，在山区坠毁，飞行员丧生。

机上仅有的乘客，一位年轻的妇女和她的两个女婴却平安无事。

此时正值隆冬季节，地上积着厚厚的雪。

这位妇女知道，即使最近的村庄也有数英里远。

天黑下来的时候，她把提箱当作小床，把两个孩子放了进去，又把所有能找到的衣服都盖在了孩子们身上。

夜里，天冷得厉害。

这位妇女尽可能地靠近孩子，甚至自己也想钻进箱子里去，只是箱子太小了。

第二天一大早，她听到头顶上有飞机飞过，但不知道怎样才能发个信号。

后来她有了一个主意。

她在雪地上踩出了“SOS”这3个字母。

幸运得很，一位飞行员看到这个信号，用无线电给最近的城镇发了报。

不久，一架直升飞机飞抵飞机失事现场，来搭救这几个幸存者。

## 英文

When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago, it crashed **[kræʃt]** in the mountains and it pilot **[ˈpaɪlət]** was killed.

The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt.

It was the middle of winter. Snow lay thick on the ground.

The woman knew that the nearest **[ˈnɪərɪst]** village was miles away.

When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find.

During the night, it got terribly cold.

The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small.

Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead **[ˌəʊvəˈhed]** and wondered how she could send a signal.

Then she had an idea.

She stamped **[stæmpt]** out the letters "SOS" in the snow.

Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.

It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene **[siːn]** to rescue the survivors **[sərˈvaɪvər]** of the plane crash.
