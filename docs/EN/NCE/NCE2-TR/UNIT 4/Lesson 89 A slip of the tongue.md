# Lesson 89 A slip of the tongue 

## 中文

口误

人们总要想尽办法看不花钱的演出 -- 哪怕是拙劣的演出。

当“皮尤”鸟食公司将在我们当地影院演出喜剧节目的消息传开后，我们都赶紧跑去观看。

我们不得不排了好几个小时才进得场去。在演出开始前场内肯定已有好几百人了。

不幸的是，这次演出是我们看过的最乏味的演出了。

那些没能进到场内的人没有必要感到失望，因为很多应该出场的专业演员都没有来。

那天晚上唯一有趣的事情是节目开始时那个报幕员的开场白。

他显然非常紧张，局促不安地在麦克风前站了好几分钟。

但他刚一开口说话，人们便哄堂大笑起来。

我们都明白那个可怜的人应该说些什么，而他实际说的却是：“这是浦伊鸟食公司，好女士们，晚上和先生们！”

## 英文

People will do anything to see a free show - even if it is a bad one.

When the news **[njuːz]** got round that a comedy **[ˈkɒmədi]** show would be presented **[prɪˈzentɪd]** at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company **[ˈkʌmpəni]**, we all rushed **[rʌʃt]** to see it.

We had to queue **[kjuː]** for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.

Unfortunately, the
 show was one of the dullest **[ˈdʌlɪst]** we have even seen.

Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes **[ɑːˈtiːsts]** who should have appeared did not come.

The only funny things we heard that evening came **[keɪm]** from the advertiser **[ˈædvətaɪzə(r)]** at the beginning of the programme **[ˈprəʊɡræm]**.

He was obviously **[ˈɒbviəsli]** every nervous **[ˈnɜːvəs]** and for some minutes **[ˈmɪnɪts]** stood awkwardly **[ˈɔːkwədli]** before the microphone.

As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing **[ˈlɑːfɪŋ]**.

We all know what the poor **[pɔː(r)]** man should have said, but what he actually said was: 

'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!'
