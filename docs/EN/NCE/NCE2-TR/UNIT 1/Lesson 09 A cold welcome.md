# Lesson 9 A cold welcome
## 中文
星期三的晚上，我们去了市政厅。

那是一年的最后一天，一大群人聚集在市政厅的大钟下面。

再过20分钟，大钟将敲响12下。

15分钟过去了，而就在11点55分时，大钟停了。

那根巨大的分针不动了。

我们等啊等啊，可情况没有变化。

突然有人喊道：“已经12点零2分了！那钟已经停了！”我看了一下我的手表，果真如此。

那座大钟不愿意迎接新年。

此时，大家已经笑了起来，同时唱起了歌。


## 英文

On Wednesday/ˈwenzdeɪ/ evening, we went the Town/taʊn/ Hall/hɔːl/.  

It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock.

It would strike twelve in twenty minutes' time.

Fifteen minutes passed/pɑːst/ and then, at five to twelve/twelv/, the clock stopped/stɒpt/. The big minute hand did not move.

We waited and waited, but nothing happened.

Suddenly someone shouted, "It's two minutes pass twelve! The clock has stopped" I looked at my watch. It was true.

The big clock refused to welcome the New Year. 

At that moment, everybody began/bɪˈɡæn/ to laugh and sing/sɪŋ/.
