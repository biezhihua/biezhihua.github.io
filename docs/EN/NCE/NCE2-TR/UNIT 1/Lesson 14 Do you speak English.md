# Lesson 14 Do you speak English

## 中文

去年我有过一次有趣的经历。

在离开法国南部的一个小村庄后，我继续驶往下一个城镇。

途中，一个青年人向我招手。

我把车停下，他向我提出要求搭车。

他一上车，我就用法语向他问好，他也同样用法语回答我。

除了个别几个单词外，我根本不会法语。

旅途中我们谁也没讲话。

就要到达那个镇时，那青年突然开了口，慢慢地说道“你会讲英语吗？” 我很快了解到，他自己就是个英国人！

## 英文

I had an amusing/əˈmjuːzɪŋ/ experience/ɪkˈspɪəriəns/ last year.

After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to next town.

On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift/lɪft/.

As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied/rɪˈplaɪd/ in the same language.

Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all.

Neither of us spoke during the journey/ˈdʒɜːni/.

I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly: "Do you speak English" As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
