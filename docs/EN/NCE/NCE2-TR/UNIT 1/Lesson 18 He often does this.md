# Lesson 18 He often does this! 

## 中文

我在一家乡村小酒店吃过午饭后，就找我的提包。

我曾把它放在门边的椅子上，可这会儿不见了！

当我正在寻找时，酒店老板走了进来。

“您吃得好吗？”他问。

“很好，谢谢。”我回答，“但我付不了帐，我的提包没有了。”

酒店老板笑了笑，马上走了出去。

一会儿工夫他拿着我的提包回来了，把它还给了我。

“实在抱歉，”他说，“我的狗把它弄到花园里去了，他常干这种事！”

## 英文

After I had had lunch/lʌntʃ/ at a village pub, I looked for my bag/bæɡ/.

I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wan't there!

As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

"Did you have a good meal?" he asked/ɑ:skt/.

"Yes, thank you!" I answered, "but I can't pay for the bill. I haven't got my bag."

The landlord smiled and immediately went out.

In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.

"I'm very sorry" he said, "My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!"
