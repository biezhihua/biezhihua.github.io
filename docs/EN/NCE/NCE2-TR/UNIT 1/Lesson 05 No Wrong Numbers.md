# Lesson 5 No Wrong Numbers
## 中文

詹姆斯-斯科特先生在锡尔伯里有一个汽车修理部，现在他刚在平赫斯特买了另一个汽车修理部。

平赫斯特离锡尔伯里只有5英里，但詹姆斯-斯科特先生未能为他新的汽车修理部搞到一部电话机，所以他买了12只鸽子。

昨天，一只鸽子把第一封信从平赫斯特带到锡尔伯里。

这只鸟只用了3分钟就飞完了全程。

到目前为止，斯科特先生从一个汽车修理部向另一个发送了大量索取备件的信件和其他紧急函件。

就这样，他开始了自己的私人“电话”业务。

詹姆斯-斯科特先生 - Mr.James Scott
锡尔伯 - Slibury
平赫斯特 - Pinhurst
