# Lesson 19 Sold out 

## 中文

“剧马上就要开演了，”我说。

“也许已经开演了呢，”苏珊回答说。

我匆匆赶到售票处，问：“我可以买两张票吗？”

“对不起，票已售完。”那位姑娘说。

“真可惜！”苏珊大声说。

正在这时，一个男子匆匆奔向售票处。

“我可以退掉这两张票吗？”他问。

“当然可以，”那姑娘说。

我马上又回到售票处。

“我可以买那两张票吗？”我问。

“当然可以，不过这两张票是下星期三的，您是否还要呢？”

“我还是买下的好，”我垂头丧气地说。


## 英文

"The play may begin/bɪˈɡɪn/ at any moment" I said.

"It may have begun/bɪˈɡʌn/ already" Susan answered.

I hurried to the ticket office. "May I have two tickets please" I asked.

"I'm sorry, we've sold out" the girl said.

"What a pity" Susan exclaimed.

Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.

"Can I return these two tickets?" he asked.

"Certainly" the girl said.

I went back to the ticket office at once.

"Could I have those two tickets please?" I asked.

"Certainly, but they're for next Wednesday's performance/pəˈfɔːməns/, Do you still want them?"

"I might as well have them" I said sadly.
