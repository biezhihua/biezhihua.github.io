# Lesson 3 Please send me a card

## 中文

明信片总是搅得我不得安宁。

去年夏天，我去了意大利。

我参观了博物馆，还去了公园。

一位好客的服务员教了我几句意大利语，之后还借给我一本书。

我读了几行，但一个字也不懂。

我每天都想着明信片的事 。

假期过得真快，可我还没有给我的朋友寄过一张明信片。

到了最后一天，我作出了一个重大决定。

我早早地起了床，买来了37张明信片。

我在房间里关了整整一天。

然而竟连一张明信片也没写成！

## 英文

Postcards alway spoil my holidays.

Last summer, I went to Italy.

I visited museums and sat in public gardens.

A friendly waiter taught me a few worlds of Italian.

Then he lent me a book. 

I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.

Everyday I thought the postcards.

My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.

On the last day I made a big decision.

I got up  early and bought thirty-seven cards.

I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write single a card.
