# Lesson 17 Always young

## 中文

我的姑姑詹妮弗是位演员，她至少也有35岁了。

尽管如此，她却常在舞台上扮演小姑娘。

詹妮弗很快又要参加一个新剧的演出。

这一次，她将扮演一个17岁的少女。

演出时她必须穿一条鲜红色的裙子和黑色的长筒袜。

去年在演另一个剧时，她不得不穿短袜和一件鲜艳的橘红色的衣服。

一旦有人问起她有多大年纪，她总是回答：“亲爱的，长成大人真可怕啊！”

In spite/spaɪt/ of this, she often/ˈɒf(ə)n/ appears on the stage as a young girl.

Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon.

This time, she will be a girl of seventeen.
