# Lesson 22 A glass envelope

## 中文

我的女儿简从未想过会接到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信。

去年，当我们横渡英吉利海峡时，简把写有她姓名和住址的一张纸条装进了一只瓶子，又将瓶子扔进了大海。

此后她就再没去想那只瓶子。但10个月以后，她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信。

现在这两位姑娘定期通信了。

然而她们还是决定利用邮局。

这样会稍微多花点钱，但肯定是快得多了。

Jane

## 英文

envelope/ˈenvələʊp/

My daughter, Jane/dʒeɪn/, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland.

Last year, we were traveling across the Channel and Jame put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle/ˈbɒt(ə)l/. She threw the bottle into the sea.

She never thought of it again, but ten months later/ˈleɪtə(r)/, she received a letter from a girl in Holland.

Both girls write to each other regularly now.

However, they have decided/dɪˈsaɪdɪd/ to use the post office.

Letters will cast/kɑːst/ a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.
