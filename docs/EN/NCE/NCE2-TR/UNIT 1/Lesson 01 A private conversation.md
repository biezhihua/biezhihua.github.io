# Lesson 1 A private conversation

## 中文

上星期我去看戏。

我的座位非常好，戏很有意思，但我却无法欣赏。

一个青年男子与一个青年女子坐在我的身后，大声地说着话。

我非常生气，因为我听不见演员在说什么。

我回过头怒视着那一男一女，他们却毫不理会。

最后，我忍不住了，又一次回过头去，生气的说：“我一个字也听不见了！”

“不管你的事,”那男的毫不客气的说，“这是私人间的谈话！”

## 英文

Last week I went to the theatre.

I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it.

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly.

I got very angry. I could not hear the actors.

I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention.

In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. I said angrily: 'I can't hear a word"

"It's none of your business" the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation"
