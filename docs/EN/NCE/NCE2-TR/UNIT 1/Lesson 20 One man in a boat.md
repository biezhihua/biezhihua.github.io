# Lesson 20 One man in a boat 

## 中文

钓鱼是我特别喜爱的一项运动。

我经常一钓数小时却一无所获，但我从不为此烦恼。

有些垂钓者就是不走运，他们往往鱼钓不到，却钓上来些旧靴子和垃圾。

我的运气甚至还不及他们。

我什么东西也未钓到过 -- 就连旧靴子也没有。

我总是在河上呆上整整一上午，然后空着袋子回家。

“你可别再钓鱼了！”我的朋友们说，“这是浪费时间。”

然而他们没有认识到重要的一点，我并不是真的对钓鱼有兴趣，我感兴趣的只是独坐孤舟，无所事事。

## 英文

Fishing is my favorite/ˈfeɪvərɪt/ sport.

Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish.

I am even/ˈiːv(ə)n/ less lucky. 

I never catch anything -- not even old boots.

After having spent/spent/ whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag.

"You must give up fishing" my friends say/seɪ/. "It's a waste of time".
