## Lesson 72 A car called  Bluebird
### First listen and then answer the question
What mistake was made?
```
The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell, was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per/pə(r)/ hour.

He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah.

Bluebird, the car he was driving, had been specially/ˈspeʃəli/ built for him.

It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2500-horsepower/ˈhɔːspaʊə(r)/ engine/ˈendʒɪn/.
 
Although Campbell reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour, 

he had great difficulty in controlling the car becuase a tyre/ˈtaɪə(r)/ burst/bɜːst/ during the first run.

After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed/ˌdɪsəˈpɔɪntɪd/ to learn that his average/ˈævərɪdʒ/ speed had been 299 milles per hour.

However, a few days later, he was told that a mistake had been made.

His average/ˈævərɪdʒ/ speed/spiːd/ had been 301 miles per hour. 

Since that time, racing driver have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour.

Following in his father's footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolm's son, Donald, also set up a world record.

Like his father, he was driving a car called Blurbird.

## Lesson 67 Volcanoes 火山

```
Haroun Tazieff, the Polish/ˈpɒlɪʃ/ scientist/ˈsaɪəntɪst/, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes/vɒlˈkeɪnəʊ/ and deep caves in all parts of the world.

In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro.

Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting/ɪˈrʌptɪŋ/ violently/ˈvaɪələntli/.

Though/尽管，让步状语从句/ he managed to take a number of brilliant/ˈbrɪliənt/ photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long.

He noticed that a river of liquid/ˈlɪkwɪd/ rock/rɒk/ was coming towards him.

It threatened/ˈθretn/ to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape/ɪˈskeɪp/ just in time.

He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return teo days later.

This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measures temperatures/ˈtemprətʃə(r)/.

Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.

## Lesson 64 The Channel Tunnel/ˈtʌnl/
### First listen and then answer the question
Why was the first tunnel not completed?
```
In 1858, a French engineer/ˌendʒɪˈnɪə(r)/, Aime Thome de Gamond,

arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel/ˈtʌnl/ under the English Channel.

He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the entre of the Channel.

This platform would serve/sɜːv/ as a port and a railway station.

The tunnel would be well-ventilated/ˈventɪleɪt/ if tall/tɔːl/ chimneys were built above sea level.

In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low.

He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.

This would solve/sɒlv/ the problem of ventilation/ˌventɪˈleɪʃn/, 

for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.

Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun/bɪˈɡʌn/.

If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion/ɪnˈveɪʒn/, it would have been completed.

The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.

It was officially opened on March 7, 1994,

finally connecting Britain/ˈbrɪtn/ to the European continent.

## Lesson 61 Trouble with the Hubble
### First listen and then answer the question
What is the special importance of a telescope in space?
```
The Hubble/ˈhʌbl/ telescope/ˈtelɪskəʊp/ was launched into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars.

Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble.

The pictures it sent us were very disappointing/ˌdɪsəˈpɔɪntɪŋ/ becuase it main mirror was faulty/ˈfɔːlti/!

NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it.

The shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble.

A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs.

Of course, the Hubble is above the earth's atmosphere/ˈætməsfɪə(r)/, 

so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies/ˈɡæləksi/ that we have ever seen.

The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.

By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days.

The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise.

A woman (whom) you know well will rush towards you.

She will speak to you and then she will lead you aways from this place.

That is all.'

As soon as I went outside, I forget all about Madam bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me.

## Lesson 59 In or out
### First listen and then answer the question
Why did Rex run away.

- because the writer's husband removed the gate.
```
Our dog, Rex, used to sit out side our front gate and bark.

Every time he wanted to come/kʌm/ into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate.

As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw/pɔː/ on the latch to let himself in.

Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate.

However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate.

This time he was barking so that someone would let him out!

Since then, he has developed another bad habit.

As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts.

Then  he sits and barks until someone lets him out.

After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again.

Yesterday my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed (that) we have not seen him since.

A woman in jeans/dʒiːnz/ stood at the window of an expensive shop.

Though/ðəʊ/ she hesitated/ˈhezɪteɪtɪd/ for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window.

The assistant who served/sɜːvd/ her did not like the way she was dressed.

Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold.

The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day.

She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other.

After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the same dress. 

Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager/ˈiːɡə(r)/ to serve her this time.

With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress.

As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like. 

She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first aksed for.

## Lesson 55 Not a gold mine
### First listen and then answer the question
What did the team find?
```
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently.

A new machine called 'The revealer/rɪ'vi:lə/' has been invented and it has been used to detect gold/ɡəʊld/ which has been buried in the ground.

The machine was used in a cave/keɪv/ near the seashore where - it is said - pirates used to hide gold.

The pirates would often bury/ˈberi/ gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.

Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure/ˈtreʒə(r)/.

The leader of the party was examining the soil/sɔɪl/ near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.

Very excited, the party dug/dʌɡ/ a hole two feet deep.

They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.

The party then then searched the whole cave thoroughly/ˈθʌrəli/ but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk/trʌŋk/.

In spite of this, many people are confident/ˈkɒnfɪdənt/ that 'The revealer' may reveal/rɪˈviːl/ something of value fairly/ˈfeəli/ soon.

### First listen and then answer the question

Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed.

For the first time in his life, he became the pround owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress.

Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on the roof of his house.

He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the thrid night, a storm blew/bluː/ up.

A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard/ˈkɔːtjɑːd/ below.

The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck/strʌk/ the ground.

Although/ɔːlˈðəʊ//conjunction/ the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt.

When he woke up, he was still on the mattress.

Glancing/ˈɡlɑːnsɪŋ/ at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.

After he had put it on the floor, he promptly went to sleep again.
