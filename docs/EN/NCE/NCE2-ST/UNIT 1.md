How did Jane receive the a letter from a stranger/ˈstreɪndʒə(r)/?

Jane put a piece of paper with her name and adrees on it into a bottle. 

She threw[θruː] the bottle into the sea.

She never thought/θɔːt/ of it again, but ten months later/ˈleɪtə(r)/, she received a letter from a gril in Holland.

Both girls write[raɪt] to each other regularly/ˈreɡjələli/ now.

Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly[ˈsɜːt(ə)nli] travel faster.

## Lesson 21 Man or not?
### First listen and then answer the question
Why do people think the writter is mad?

- The wirter is determined to stay here.
   -   粗略分析就分成两部分：
      - be determined to do sth. 决定做某事 是一个短语
      -  是主语，am determined to stay here是谓语部分
   -  细分析到每个词：
      - I 是主语
      - am 是系动词，determined是形容词 作表语，后面的的动词不定式to stay here主语补足语。
      - 也可以把am determined 看成是被动语态，一起作谓语动词。后面的的动词不定式to stay here依然作主语补足语。
      - 变成主动语态：I determine myself to stay here. ( I 是主语，determine是谓语动词，myself是宾语，to stay here是宾语补足语。
      - It came into use. 这句中，use 是名词，放在介词into的后面作宾语，came into是动词短语“进入”，作谓语动词。  
```
Airplanes/ˈeəpleɪn/ are slowly driving me mad/mæd/. 

I live near an airport and passing planes/pleɪn/ can be heard[hɜːd] night and day.

The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then.

Last year, however, it came[keɪm] into use.

Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise.

I am one of few people left. 

Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane.

I have been offered a large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here.

Everybody says I must be mad/mæd/ and they are probably[ˈprɒbəbli] right.

### Active and passive
[https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/easy-learning/what-is-the-passive-form-of-a-verb-in-english](https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/easy-learning/what-is-the-passive-form-of-a-verb-in-english)

- What is the passive form of a verb in English?
   - The passive is made with the appropriate form of be + the past participle of the main verb.
   - The subject in a passive sentence is not the person or thing that does the action of the verb. It is the person or thing that is acted on by the verb.
      - subject 主语
      - object 宾语
      - does the action of the verb
      - is acted on 
- When do you use the passive in English
   -  We use the passive to direct our listener’s attention to the important part of our message  
   -  The passive can be used when we do not know who carries out the action expressed by the verb, or when it is not important that we should know. It is sometimes much more important to know what has happened than who or what did it.  
   - The passive allows us to select the parts of a sentence to which we want to draw attention. It can be used when we want to focus on:
      -  the agent, i.e. who brought the action about. We show the agent with by.  
      -  the instrument, i.e. what was used to make the action happen. We show the instrument with by or with.  
      -  the means, i.e. what caused the action to happen. We show the means with by or with.  
- What is the position of the subject and object in a passive sentence? -
- How do you form the passive in English?
   - Passive verbs are made from a form of be + the past participle of a main verb. In the passive, the form of the auxiliary verb be indicates the tense.
   -  Some verbs are only or mostly used in the passive, e.g. be born and be deemed.  
   - When you want to report what is or was generally understood or accepted by a group of people, you can use the impersonal passive.
   - The form it + passive + that can be used when you do not want to mention the source of a report or rumour.

Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots[buːts] and rubbish. 

I am even less lucky.

I never catch anyhting - not even old boots.

After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag.

But they don't realize one important thing.

I'm not really interested[ˈɪntrəstɪd] in fishing.

I an only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!.

间接宾语在多数情况下置于直接宾语之前，如果间接宾语在后，间接宾语前必须加to（表示动作对什么人而做）或for（表示动作为什么人而做）。

- He lent me a book
- He sent me a card.
- He passed me the salt.
