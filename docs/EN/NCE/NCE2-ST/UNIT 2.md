## **Lesson 48 Did you want to tell me something?**
Why did the writer become very worried?

- because the destist had pulled out the wrong tooth.
```
Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.

My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth/tiːθ/ and had told me to rest for a while.

I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool.

He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing.

He then asked me how my brother was whether I liked my new job in London.
  
In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises.

Meanwhile, my tongue/tʌŋ/ was busy searching out the hole where the tooth/tuːθ/ had been.

I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say nothing.

When the dentist at last removed the cotton wool from my mouth/maʊθ/, 

I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.

## Lesson 41 Do you call that a hat?
### First listen and then answer the question
What kind of shopping does the writer enjoy, do you think?

- The writer enjoy tie shop
```
'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.

'You needn't be so rude about it.' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.

I sat down on one of those modern chair with holes/həʊl/ in it and waited.

We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.

'We mustn't buy things we don't need' I remarked suddenly. 

I regreted/rɪˈɡret/ saying it almost/ˈɔːlməʊst/ at once.

'You needn't have said that' my wife answered.

'I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday'

'I find it beautiful' I said.

'A man can never have too many ties'

'And a woman can't have too many hats' she answered.

Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together.

My wife was wearing a hat that looked like lighthouse!

### Notes on the text

- ... needn't be so rude.
   - 英语中实际上有两个need。
      - 一个是普通动词need；
         - need sth
         - need to do 
         - need sb todo
         - need doing 需要被做某事
            - she need some time.
            - he needs to have a rest
            - he needs friends to help him
            - his bag need mending
      - 另一个是情态动词need。情态动词的need和can、may等情态动词一样，后接动词原形，但只用于否定和疑问句，肯定句用must、have to、outght to、should。
         - 正常形式
            - need do 
               - Need I finish it now?
            - need do have done
         - 否定形式：
            - needn't	
- I regretted saying 
   - regret 后接动名词表示对做过的事感到抱歉。
   - regret doing
- We mustn't buy things we don't need.
   - need是普通动词，当需要讲。
- You needn't have said that
   - 虚拟 - needn't have done 表示本不用做，但实际上做了。
   - 虚拟 - need have done 表示本可以做，但是没做。
   - 真实 - needn't do  不需要做，就真的不做。
- I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.
   - remind sb of sth 提醒某人想起某事.
- I find it beautiful.
   - beautiful 用来补充说明it，在语法上称作宾语补足语。
- A woman can't have too many hats.
   - A man can never have too many ties.
   - too的意思和so,such都是"很"的意思,加强程度

too和so such的区别是
too所带有的意味是"太多 太过了" 一种过分的意思.
而so such没有这种意味,仅仅起加强的作用.
所以这句话假如说成
A man has too many ties.就是说一个男人的领带太多了(有一种抱怨 嫌弃的情感)
若加上can never说成A man can never have too many ties.
直译为 "一个男人从来不会有太多的领带"(再多也不过分)
所以根据句意 意译为男人有多少领带也不宪多.
翻译好这类句子主要体会"too"这个词的情感
类似的句子有 You can never drive too slow.
翻译为 你车开的再慢也不为过(即提醒小心驾车,不要怕开慢了

## Lesson 33 Out of the darknesss 冲出黑暗
### First listen and then answer the question
Why was the gril in hospital?

- Because she was caught in a strom.
```
Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain what had happened to her.

One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small boat and was caught in a storm.

Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl jumped into the sea.

Then she swam to the shore after spending the whole night in the water.

During that time she covered a distance of eight miles.

Early next morning, she saw a light ahead.

She knew she was near the shore becuase the light was high up on the cliffs.

On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light she had seen.

That was all she remembered.

When she woke up a day later, she found herself in hospital.

## Lesson 31 Success[səkˈses] story 成功者故事
### First listen and then answer the question
What was Frank's first job?

- Frank's first job is to repair bicycles.
```
Yesterday afternoon Frank[fræŋk] Hawkins[ˈhɔːkɪnz] was telling me about his experiences[ɪk'spɪrɪənsɪz] as a young man.

Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop.

It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day.

He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own.

In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes. 

At that time he had two helpers.

In a few/fjuː/ years the small workshop had become a large factory/ˈfæktri/ which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people.

Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success. 

He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came/keɪm/ in.

She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!

### First listen and then answer the question
What happened to the man in the boat?

- A ball went towards to the man in the boat.
```
The Wayle/weil/ is a small river that cuts across the park near my home.

I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons.

It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual.

Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.

Suddenly, one of the children kicked/kɪkt/ a ball[bɔːl] very hard and it went towards passing boat. 

Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them.

The ball[bɔːl] struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight : they had all run away!

The man laughed when he realized what had happened.

He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.

##### What's the time?
People often collect things. Stamps, books and records are fairly common. But the strangest collection I have ever seen belongs to a man who possesses 1500 clocks. There are clocks in every room of his house. The living room is lined with shelves which have been filled with clocks. As there is no enough room for so many clock, the man has filled several trunks and stored them in the garage. His wife complains every day about the work she has to do, for it is not easy to dust several hundred clocks. She also complains about the noise. Each clock keeps its own time, so chimes can be heard almost any time during the day and night. In her opinion, however, there is something even worse than dust and noise. Even with so many clocks around, she never knows what time it is!.
