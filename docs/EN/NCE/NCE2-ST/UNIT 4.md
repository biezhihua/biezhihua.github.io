## Lesson 96 The dead return 
What happens to the lantern/ˈlæntən/ at the end of the festival/ˈfestɪvl/?
```
A Festival/ˈfestɪvl/ for the Dead is held once a year in Japan.

The festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living.

As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them.

Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way.

All night long, people dance and sing/sɪŋ/. 

In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living/ˈlɪvɪŋ/ to eat it.

In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over.

Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world.

This is a moving spectacle/ˈspektəkl/, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.

Experiments/ɪk'sperɪm(ə)nts/ have proved that children can be instructed/ɪnˈstrʌktɪd/ in swimming at very early/ˈɜːli/ age.

At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath/breθ/ under water even before they can walk.

Babies of two months old do not appear to be relucatnt/rɪˈlʌktənt/ enter/ˈentə(r)/ the water. 

It is not long before they are so accustomed/əˈkʌstəmd/ to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool.

A game that is very popular with these young simmers/ˈsɪmə(r)/ is the underwater tricycle/ˈtraɪsɪk(ə)l/ race.

Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.

The children complete against each other to reach the other end of the pool.

Many pedal/ˈped(ə)l/ their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them.

Some children can cover the while length of the pool without coming up for breath even once.

What kind of fish are they?
```
Fish and chips/tʃɪps/ has always been a favourite/ˈfeɪvərɪt/ dish in Britain/ˈbrɪt(ə)n/, but as the oceans/'əʊʃnz/ have been overfished/ˌəʊvəˈfɪʃ/, fish has become and more expensive.

So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant/ˈdʒaɪənt/ fish are terrifying/ˈterɪfaɪɪŋ/ the divers on North Sea oil rigs/ɔɪl rɪɡz/.

Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, 

who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.

Now they have had special cages/ˈkeɪdʒɪz/ made to protect them from these monsters/'mɒnstəz/.

The fish are not sharks/ʃɑːks/ or killer whales/weɪlz/, but favourite eating varieties/vəˈraɪətiz/ like cod/kɒd/ and skate/skeɪt/ which grow to unnatural/ʌnˈnætʃrəl/ size, 

sometimes as tweleve feet in length.

Three factors/'fæktəz/ have caused these fish to grow so large: 

the warm water round the hot oil/ɔɪl/ pipes/paɪps/ under the sea; 

the plentiful/ˈplentɪfl/ supply/səˈplaɪ/ of food thrown overboard/ˈəʊvəbɔːd/ by the crew/kruː/ on the rigs/rɪɡz/;

the total absence/ˈæbsəns/ of fishing boats around the oil rigs.

As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water.

- be frightened out of their wits 被吓得惊慌失措

He was obviously every nervous and for some mintues stood awkwardly/ˈɔːkwədli/ before the microphone.

Some time ago, however, a peculiar/pɪˈkjuːliə(r)/ fish was caught near Madagascar.

A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.

Realizing that this was no ordinary/ˈɔːdnri/ fish, the fisherman made every effort/ˈefət/ not to damage it in any way.

When it was eventually bruoght to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.

It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining/ˈʃaɪnɪŋ/ sliver/ˈslɪvə(r)/ skin/skɪn/, and a bright read tail.

The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is begin examined by a scientist/ˈsaɪəntɪst/, it called an oarfish.

Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

When it grew/ɡruː/ dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find.

During the night, it got terribly cold.

Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal.

Then she had an idea.

She stampled out the letter "SOS" in the snow.

Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town.

It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene/siːn/ to rescue/ˈreskjuː/ the survivors of the plane/pleɪn/ crash.

### First listen and then answer the question
Did the boy go where he wanted to ?
```
Children who play truant from school are unimaginative.

A quiet/ˈkwaɪət/ day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get.

They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant/ˈtruːənt/, travelled 1600 miles.

He hitchhiked to Dover and , towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.

When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boad had, in the meantime, travelled to Calais/ˈkæleɪ/ .

No one noticed the boy as he crept/krept/ off.

From there, he hitchhiked/ˈhɪtʃhaɪk/ ot Paris in a lorry.

The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.

The next car the boy stopped/stɒpt/ did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border/ˈbɔːdə(r)/ .

There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities/ɔːˈθɒrəti/.

He has surely set up a record for the thoundsands of children who dream of evading school.
